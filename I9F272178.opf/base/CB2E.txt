b) [Qualities of the teacher (śāstṛsaṃpad):] The Lord had fully woken up to the fact that all moments of existence are of the same character, he had set the wheel of religion in motion (supravartitadharmacakro), training endless hosts of pupils (’nantaśiṣyagaṇasuvinītaḥ), having attained mastery over all moments of existence (sarvadharmavaśitāprāptaḥ),he had set the wheel of religion in motion,training endless hosts of pupils,having attained mastery over all moments of existence,knowing well all kinds of intentions in living beings,having obtained exquisite abilities of perception, etc.,skilful in subduing the habits of vice which are connections [to new births] in all beings,never ceasing to perform his effortless Buddha-activities.
c) [Qualities of the congregation of monks (śrāvakaparṣatsaṃpad):] With him was a great congregation of six million monks,all of them with disciplined minds,free [from the obscurations of vices (kleśāvaraṇa) ] in thought because of right knowledge [of the four noble truths],making efforts to subdue all habits of vice which are connections [to new births],sons of the Tathāgata, the king of religion,skilled in behaving according to the deep religion of the Buddha,perfected in the moments of existence beyond objectification,perfected by their gracious behaviour,very worthy of gifts [as the fruit of giving to them will be great],punctilious in following the instructions of the Tathāgata.
d) [Qualities of the congregation of bodhisattvas (bodhisattvaparṣatsaṃpad):] With him was also a great congregation of bodhisattvas.The bodhisattvas, the great beings, had assembled from different Buddha-fields and they were innumerable, their number was infinite, immeasurable, unthinkable, beyond measure, unspeakableThey were possessed of the power to pass through infinite Buddha-fields in an instant [to hear teachings in the presence of Tathāgatas], and thus skilled in coming and going,ready to pay homage to and serve all the Tathāgatas,untiring in the quest to hear the religion of the Buddha,constantly striving to bring all beings to spiritual maturity,having attained the highest in skill in means and insight,established in unobstructed liberation and wisdom,transcending all thought-constructions, fictions and discursive thinking,near the stage of omniscience [the fruit, the stage of a Buddha]They were the bodhisattva Vidyuddeva, the bodhisattva Yuddhajaya, the bodhisattva Vairocanagarbha, the bodhisattva Parākramavikrama, the bodhisattva Vimatisamudghātin, the bodhisattva Vighuṣṭaśabda, the bodhisattva Vyavalokanacakṣur, the bodhisattva Vigatatamas, the bodhisattvas Maitreya and Mañjuśrī and so on, with innumerable bodhisattvas, great beings whose number was immeasurable, beyond measure, unthinkable, unequalled, incomparable, peerless, infinite, unspeakable, again unspeakable.
Introduction
a) [Qualities of the teaching (nirdeśasaṃpad):] Then the Lord, the discourse on religion called The Unobstructed Gate of Penetration into and Going Forth in the Practice of a Bodhisattva [being the body (kāya) of this sūtra],which [has the following properties (guṇa):] has the arrangement of the bodhisattva’s way as its object,is the source of the wisdom that accomplishes all the profound teachings of a Buddha [on selflessness in the person and the moments of existence], the ten powers and his intrepidities,is the entering of the gate which is the seal of retaining in memory, the method for mastering all moments of existence,is the entering of the gate leading to the well determined special kinds of knowledge,is the entering of the gate leading to knowledge of the great supernormal knowledges,is the wheel of religion never turning back [from the incomparable awakening (anuttarabodhi) ],is teaching the religion of not turning back, the religion of non-origination,is uniting to the way to be traversed alone,is uniting all ways in the sameness of the one way,is the entrance into the unadulterated totality of all moments of existence which is of one single principle,is the teaching of how to understand intentions and abilities in all beings,is determining the religion that conforms to the essential [which is not destroyed by the Evil One and the heretics],is the destruction of all regions of the Evil One,is the entering of the gate leading to the basic moments of existence,is subduing all vices and views,is in accordance with unhindered insight and knowledge,is teaching the knowledge of expedient means which is skill in transforming [into awakening] in an infinite and incomparable way,is in accordance with knowledge of the fact that all qualities of a Buddha are the same [and of one taste in being empty (śūnyataikarasa) ],is the entering of the gate into mastering the unhindered knowledge [in seeing all things without effort (anābhoga) ],is the teaching of all moments of existence such as they really are,is the entering into the sameness which is beyond thought-constructions and fictions,is the understanding of the deep dependent origination,is the gathering of the complete accumulation of great merit and knowledge,is in accordance with the sameness of the Buddha’s ornaments of body, speech and mind,is realization of imperishable recollection, intelligence, understanding, devotion and insight,is the entrance into the teaching of the noble truths for the sake of those to be educated by means of the disciples’ way,is knowledge of physical and mental isolation [like the rhinoceros (khaḍgaviṣāṇakalpa) ] for the sake of those to be educated by means of the isolated buddha’s way,is attainment of the consecration for the stage of omniscience [or buddhahood] for the sake of those to be educated by means of the great way,and is the entrance into the method for mastery [by knowledge] of all moments of existence for the sake of proclaiming the virtues of the Tathāgatas,he taught, pointed out, made clear, declared, made accepted, caused to be recited, made known, announced, explained, displayed, revealed, defined, proclaimed, and expounded.
b) [Qualities of the radiance accompanying the teaching (nirdeśānugataraśmisaṃpad):] Then, as the Lord was explaining that discourse on religion, a section of “The Great Collection” with its well determined meanings, a great golden light appeared in the east. That golden light illumined the whole citadel adorned with jewels, as well as this system of threefold thousand great thousands of worlds. And except for the light of the Tathāgatas and the consecrated bodhisattvas, all other lights in this system of threefold thousand great thousands of worlds, the light of the sun and the moon, the light of Indra, Brahma or the protectors of the world, the light of gods, snake-gods, demons, celestial musicians, giants, divine birds, man-horses and great serpents, the radiance of fire, gems, jewels, lightning and the stars were all eclipsed, obscured and darkened. And even the forms heaped up in the spaces between the worlds of this system of threefold thousand great thousands of worlds, in utter darkness, where even the sun and the moon - having such great power, such great strength - do not shine, illuminate or shed beams, even they were illumined by that light. Grasses, bushes, herbs and trees did not obstruct that radiance, even black mountains, snow-mountains, Mt. Sumeru, Mt. Cakravāḍa, Mt. Mucilinda, Mt. Mahāmucilinda, and all the great kings of mountains did not obstruct it. And when it had penetrated everywhere, right down to the great Avīci hell, the whole of this system of threefold thousand great thousands of worlds was filled with light. And all the beings who were inhabitants of hell, animals or inhabitants of Yāma’s kingdom, whose bodies were touched by that light, thought: “I am in possession of every pleasure”, having no painful sensations, and being pleased in body and mind.
c) [Qualities of the occasion for the teaching (nirdeśanidānasaṃpad):] All around the perimeter of the assembly in the presence of the Lord in the citadel adorned with jewels, sixty times ten millions of seven-jewel lotuses appeared, rising up out of the bowels of the earth, the size of a wagon wheel across, with several hundred thousand times ten millions of petals, sweet-smelling, of variegated colours, beautiful to behold, colourful, pleasing, covered with a net of jewel-parasols, soft and pleasant to touch like kācilinda tissue. The fragrance of each of those jewel-lotuses filled a system of threefold thousand great thousands of worlds, and whatever fragrance is found among gods and men in this system of threefold thousand great thousands of worlds was overcome by the fragrance of that lotus. As the sense of smell of gods, men, snakes, demons, celestial musicians, giants, divine birds, man-horses and great serpents was struck by that fragrance, they all thought “I am without vices”, and were happy with religion.The venerable Ānanda saw that golden radiance and that marvellous array of lotuses. Seeing them, he was greatly astonished and amazed, and getting up from his seat he put his cloak over his shoulder, and placing his right knee on the ground he bowed in the direction of the Lord with the palms of his hands joined, saying: - Lord, such a radiance, beautiful to behold, is seen; this array of lotuses, never seen before, never heard of before, has appeared. Of whom is this a presage? To Ānanda, having spoken thus, the Lord spoke these words: - This, Ānanda, is the presage of the coming of the bodhisattva Akshayamati, who is coming from the eastern quarter, together with sixty times ten millions of bodhisattvas who accompany him and attend upon him. It is the presage of their coming.
d) [Praising the greatness of the teacher (śāstṛmahātmyakīrtisaṃpad):] Not long after the Lord had spoken thus, the bodhisattva Akshayamati, shaking the earth, and emitting rays of light by the bodhisattva’s power, by the bodhisattva’s might, by the bodhisattva’s magic letting fall a great rain of flowers, and sounding a hundred thousand times ten million of hundred billions of cymbals as well as songs, arrived with sixty times ten millions of bodhisattvas who accompanied him and attended upon him where the citadel adorned with jewels was, where the Lord was staying. Having arrived he sat down in the air before the Lord, seven tāla-heights above the ground. Joining the palms of his hands he filled this system of threefold thousand great thousand worlds with sound and praised the Lord with these suitable verses:
1) Pure, without impurities, the hero whose covetousness is gone, your three eyes are purified and there is no obscuration in your wisdom; you have given up hate, rejecting the three kinds of moral filth and harshness, to the awakened without impurities I bow.
2) Without fear, doing away with delusion, you of the ten powers are hard to subdue for loquacious opponents. You frighten those who walk faulty ways; you walk the earth like a fearless lion.
3) In the celestial worlds your body, faultless and pure, is shining; having done away with ignorance dark and blinding you shine like the sun, freed from the net of the clouds.
4) The worlds are suffering, being without refuge and protection, tormented by old age and death, without any firm standing. But you, the greatest of beings, come here out of compasssion like a physician to free us.
5) Out of the sea of existence, of ignorance and vices, hard to cross, out of the many billows of vice and fictions of all kinds you emerge by yourself, not having heard from others, you come here undefiled like a lotus.
6) All these moments of existence are essentially without a self, they arise under certain conditions, just like the sound of an echo. Lord of the world, for the good of living beings you teach that they are not made, there is no maker, no entity to experience them either.
7) The ways of the world are changeable like a mountain brook in this world, still the ignorant cling to that which has no core. When knowing, however, that all moments of existence are like autumn clouds, they pass beyond existence, they despise existence.
----------
8) Your eyes are like blooming lotus-flowers shining more than a hundred suns and moons; worthy of praise you are praised and extolled by the whole world, freed from the illness which is lack of discipline, to you I bow.
9) Mighty one, you have reached unlimited perfection, your qualities have been perfected in the most distinguished way, the qualities of the one who has left happily cannot be measured; I bow my head to the awakened one, the field of merit.
Having praised the Lord with these suitable verses, the bodhisattva Akshayamati together with the sixty times ten millions of bodhisattvas, came down from the sky above, greeting the Lord by bowing to his feet with his head and circumambulating him seven times [to purify the seven kinds of actions by body and speech]. And with the Lord’s permission they sat down in the calyxes of the lotuses with their legs crossed.
e) [Conversation to determine (niścayakathā):] Then, by the power of the Buddha, the venerable Śāradvatīputra got up from his seat, and having put his cloak over one shoulder he placed his right knee on the ground, and bowed in the direction of the Lord with the palms of his hands joined, saying:
- Lord, from where does this bodhisattva Akshayamati come? What is the name of the Tathāgata there, and what is the name of that world-sphere? And how far away from here is that world-sphere?
The Lord said: Śāradvatīputra, you should ask this bodhisattva Akshayamati, and he will instruct you.
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra spoke these words to the bodhisattva Akshayamati: Son of good family, where do you come from? What is the name of the Tathāgata there, and what is the name of that world-sphere? And how far away from here is that world-sphere?
Akshayamati said: Do concepts of coming and going occur even to the elder Śāradvatīputra?
Śāradvatīputra said: Son of good family, I know concepts thoroughly.
Akshayamati said: One knowing concepts thoroughly, Śāradvatīputra, does not indulge in duality of thought, so why do you think thus: Who are you, where do you come from?
Coming, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is a word for uniting, while going, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is a word for separation. Where there is no word for uniting and no word for separation, there is no coming nor going [as there is no individuality (puruṣa) which is the subject of going (gantṛ) ]1 : not coming nor going is the way2 of the saints.
Coming, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of action-nature, while going, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of the end of action-nature. Where there is no essential character of action-nature, and no essential character of the end of action-nature, there is no coming nor going: not coming nor going is the way of the saints.
Coming, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of wishing, while going, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of the end of wishing. Where there is no essential character of wishing, and no essential character of the end of wishing, there is no coming nor going: not coming nor going is the way of the saints.
Coming, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of arising, while going, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of cessation. Where there is no essential character of arising, and no essential character of cessation, there is no coming nor going: not coming nor going is the way of the saints.
Coming, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of the way into information, while going, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of the end of the way into information. Where there is no essential character of the way into information, and no essential character of the end of the way into information, there is no coming nor going: not coming nor going is the way of the saints.
Coming, reverend Śāradvatīputra, belongs to the sphere of coming, while going, reverend Śāradvatīputra, belongs to the sphere of going. Where there is no sphere of coming and no sphere of going, there is no coming nor going: not coming nor going is the way of the saints.
----------
Coming, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of a condition, while going, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of the end of a condition. Where there is no essential character of condition, and no essential character of the end of a condition, there is no coming nor going: not coming nor going is the way of the saints.
Coming, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of dependent origination, while going, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of the end of dependent origination. Where there is no essential character of dependent origination, and no essential character of the end of dependent origination, there is no coming nor going: not coming nor going is the way of the saints.
Coming, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of having a cause, while going, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the essential character of the end of having a cause. Where there is no essential character of having a cause, and no essential character of the end of having a cause, there is no coming nor going: not coming nor going is the way of the saints.
Coming, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is an expression, a word, a syllable, a conventional sign, while going, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the thorough knowledge of an expression, a word, a syllable, a conventional sign. Where there is no expression, no word, no syllable, no conventional sign, and no thorough knowledge of an expression, a word, a syllable, a conventional sign, there is no coming nor going: not coming nor going is the way of the saints.
f) [The Tathāgata staying here praises the qualities of the other Tathāgata in answer to the question:] Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra spoke these words to the bodhisattva Akshayamati: Son of good family, I did not ask you for the sake of your eloquence, but to hear of such places I never heard of before.
Son of good family, just like a man who is a collector of village fees or taxes, who asks a man with or without a load as he goes along the road: Hello there, my good man, what are you carrying? and then: Give me village fee and taxes [for the king]!in the same way, son of good family, we disciples, who following the words of others and having confidence in what we hear from others, are concerned only with what is to be seen in the course of our own thoughts [not like the bodhisattvas who strive to purify the thoughts of others], should always ask true persons like you so as to grasp [some of the goods, meaning or advantage (artha) of] this great way [which is the expedient (upāya) ], from which many disciples and isolated buddhas are likely to arise.Therefore, you should, son of good family, demonstrate as it is where you come from, what is the name of the Tathāgata there and the name of that world-sphere.
Akshayamati said: — Śāradvatīputra, as this Tathāgata is sitting just before you, ask him and he will answer you so that the whole assembly will be without doubt.
Then again the venerable Śāradvatīputra spoke these words to the Lord: Lord, where does this bodhisattva Akshayamati come from? What is the name of the Tathāgata there, and what is the name of that world-sphere? And how far away from here is that world-sphere? So that living beings whose number is without end, who cannot be counted, will put on the armour for the sake of awakening when they have heard the name of that Tathāgata, and the name of that Buddha-field, may the Tathāgata please teach us, may the Lord, the happy one please teach us!
The Lord said: Because of that, Śāradvatīputra, listen well and intently, keep it in mind, and I will tell you. And having heard the elucidation of the qualities of that world-sphere, the names of those bodhisattvas and that Tathāgata, one should, with faith and confidence, have no fear and no doubts as to the unattached and unhindered wisdom of the Tathāgata.
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra applauded the Lord, gave his ear to the Lord, and the Lord spoke: There is, Śāradvatīputra, a world-sphere called Unblinking, which lies east of this Buddha-field, past as many Buddha-fields from here as there are dustlike grains of sand in ten Gaṅgā-rivers. There a Tathāgata, worthy of offerings, fully awakened, Samantabhadra by name stays [in accordance with the four ways of behaviour], remains [in the world, not entering extinction], and lives on [doing the good of living beings], teaching religion. Thence the bodhisattva Akshayamati comes. There, Śāradvatīputra, in the Buddha-field Unblinking, there is not even the concept of disciples and isolated buddhas, and so the congregation of that Tathāgata consists of bodhisattvas only.who have prepared themselves in the past;are firmly rooted in self-control, discipline, self-mastery, gentleness, morality, learning, care, and the qualities of purity and restriction;are without aversion by their power of tolerance;have piled up masses of good with firm vigour for the sake of awakening;play with the [four] meditations, [eight] liberations, concentrations, attainments of meditation and supernormal knowledge;are proficient in understanding the words of all the teachings of the Buddha and the knowledge of teaching them by the great shining light of insight;have friendly thoughts like the expanse of heaven;know the way to bring all living beings to maturity through their firm intention of compassion;have a joyful relation to religion through joy;are beyond conflicts through equanimity having completely done away with aversion and conceit connected with anger and affection;are firmly rooted in the way of [that is, the concentration on] moments of existence as empty, beyond distinguishing marks and wishes;rid themselves of the hook of the Evil One, and of the impurities of vices and quarrelsomeness;know the ways of intentions and abilities in all living beings, if they are good or feeble;give them religion, goods or knowledge accordingly;whose thoughts are similar to earth, water, fire or wind [in the same way as the elements nourish all living beings equally, the thoughts of the bodhisattvas nourish living beings equally in producing roots for the good in them];destroy the assemblies of quarreling opponents with their false entourage;are heroes never turning back, with raised banners and flags in the victory of the battle;are free from any fear or anxiety in any assembly through the profound qualities of a buddha, the ten powers and intrepidities;have entered upon the middle way, having given up the two extreme views of being and non-being in understanding dependent origination;are freed from all appearances of views [of grasping for] a self, [something] self-related, an animated being [that is a self in the thoughts, in the unbroken continuity of thoughts (cittasaṃtāna) ], a life-principle [dependent on the body], a [transmigrant] soul, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit, a personality [grasping again and again for existence], a man or human [as created by prajāpati], a creator [a permanent self by whom all, good and bad and so on, is made], a self experiencing [fruits of past deeds (kṛtakarmaphala) ], permanence [of the self], disappearance [of the self], existence and non-existence;are sealed with the seal of the Tathāgata, the formula for retaining in memory, the king of sacred texts;whose eloquence is unbroken because of unattached wisdom’s power, even when speaking for a hundred thousand times ten million times a hundred billion world-ages;are proficient in approaching and departing from Buddha-fields endless in number, in coming and going, because of a buddha’s demonstration of magic, wonders and supernormal powers;have cut off fear, anger, conceit, infatuation and haughtiness;utter a lion’s roar;are reliable friends of all beings, superior, average or inferior, establishing them in extinction;send down the thunder from the cloud of religion [teaching the perfections, giving and so on], the lightning of [the three kinds of] reasoning and liberation [from vices (kleśa) ], pouring down the rain of ambrosia [the thirty seven moments of existence being wings of awakening (bodhipakṣikadharma) ];do not break the continuity of the three jewels, sprinkling the jewels of religion [like the moments of existence being wings of awakening (bodhipakṣikadharma) and so on];whose intentions are pure like gems and whose reason is purified as to both inner and outer things;are adorned with ornaments shining with their own brilliance, to wit, the excellent characteristics of a great being and the marks of beauty, [caused by] a hundred thousand potentialities for the good;are consecrated with all the qualities of a Buddha and are crown-princes bound to incarnate only once more;discern the confidence and the kind of liberation of each living being, and the way to train those to be trained;know the way not to have fear but to be courageous in approaching the stage which consists in staying in the place which is the seat of awakening;display all the acts as well as the body of a Buddha being heroes of thought having the power to attract and control, and turn the jewel of the wheel of incomparable religion.The whole congregation of that Tathāgata, Śāradvatīputra, consists of bodhisattvas of that kind.
Then the whole assembly was satisfied and content, happy in mind and rejoicing, and joy and good temper were born in them as they heard such a demonstration of praise and eulogy of good qualities of those bodhisattvas. They sprinkled the Lord, the bodhisattva Akṣayamati and those bodhisattvas with celestial flowers, with blue lotuses, red lotuses, white lotuses, mandāra-flowers and great mandāra-flowers saying: “What we have attained in seeing, paying homage to and honouring these good men is really propitious!” And those beings who had produced the thought of incomparable perfect awakening as they heard that eulogy of bodhisattva-qualities said: “A propitious attainment!” And thirty six times a hundred thousand beings produced the thought of awakening.
Then the Lord spoke to the elder Śāradvatīputra [to display the purity of the place]: – Further, Śāradvatīputra, there in that world-sphere Animiṣā there are not even words for lower worlds, unfavorable conditions or suffering [to say nothing of the thing itself (kiṃ punar vādo vastu)];[and thus] nor the word for the bewilderment of sin, for vices;nor the word for wrong attainments or neglect of discipline;nor the word for being born with female sex;nor the word for envy, corrupted morality, malice, inattention or corrupted insight [the adversaries of the six perfections (pāramitāvipakṣa) ];nor the word for obstructions and interruptions, either manifest or as potentialities;nor the word for superior, average or inferior;nor the word for difference among beings, religious ways or Buddha-fields, nor the word for difference among Buddhas, nor the word for difference in religion, nor the word for difference among congregations;nor the word for food and drink, hunger and thirst, nor the word for me, mine or property;or nor the word for the Evil One [namely, being careless with bad things (akuśalapramāda) ] and related views [like pretending life is without end], manifest or potential;
That world is broad and wide, having sixty times ten million times a hundred billion times a hundred thousand continents, and because of the vows of the bodhisattvas it is illumined all over by the light of one sun and moon.Further, in that world-sphere the ground is level like the surface of water and made of blue lapis lazuli, set with all kinds of jewels, pleasant to touch like soft cloth, patterned like a chess-board, adorned with jewel-trees, beautified with flowers always blooming, without rocks, stones, gravel, pebbles and black mountains, adorned with Sumeru-mountains.There is no difference in the enjoyments of gods and men, and the food of those beings is joy in religion and the food of meditation.There in that world-sphere there is no other king apart from the peerless king of religion, the Tathāgata worthy of offerings, the perfectly awakened one Samantabhadra.
And that Lord does not teach religion to those bodhisattvas through differentiation by syllables, words and conventional phrases [like the Lord Śākyamuni], but the bodhisattvas go to that Lord, and looking at him with eyes unblinking they attain concentration which consists in recollection of the Buddha, and he gives them the prophecy which is connected with the attainment of the tolerance that all moments of existence are unborn. That is why that world-sphere is called “Unblinking”.
What then is recollection of the Buddha? [Not the recollection which is applying the mind to the qualities of the Buddha (na guṇamanasikārānusmṛtiḥ):]
It is not brought about through [recollection of the Buddha’s] corporeal marks [that belong to the body of joy (saṃbhogakāya) but recollection of his absolute body (dharmakāya) that has no characteristics];not brought about through [recollection of his] lineage, family or social standing [that belong to his body of appearance (nirmāṇakāya) ];not brought about through [recollection of] past good practice [as the perfections, being the cause (hetu) of buddhahood];not brought forth through reflecting on knowledge [namely, the fruit (phala) of that good practice which is omniscience (sarvajñajñāna) to be attained] in the future;not brought about through [reflecting on] those [Tathāgatas] who exist in the present;[Doing away with the objects of thought that are errors in the recollection of the Buddha, having distinguishing marks (buddhānusmṛtisanimittadoṣālambanaprahāṇa): beyond the forms of distinguishing marks of anything that can be be known (jñeyanimittākārātikrānta), and thus] it is not brought about through [recollection concerned with] parts of the personality, spheres and fields of the senses;not brought about through [recollection of] what has been seen, heard, imagined or comprehended;not brought about through thought, mind or consciousness;not brought about through discursive thought and mental activity;not brought about through [recollection of] origination, existence and destruction;not brought about through grasping, disaccord or rejection;not brought about through recollection and mental effort;not brought about through thought-constructions, imaginings and fictions;not brought about through [recollection on] the [general] character (sāmanyalakṣaṇa) of moments of existence [impermanence and so on], nor the special character [like the element earth, hardness, etc.];not brought about through [recollection of] homogeneousness, difference and separation;not brought about through counting objects of thought [in meditation, like breathing (śvāsa) going in and out];not brought about with inner [when tasting the states of concentration (samādhyāsvāda) ] or outer [when meeting the objects with thoughts] movement;not brought about through grasping or rejecting the differentiating marks in imagining;not brought about through [recollection of] qualities of colour and form;not brought about through the practice of deportment and behaviour;not brought about through [recollection of] morality, concentration, insight, deliverance or knowledge of deliverance;not brought about through imputing the powers, intrepidities or special qualities of a Buddha;
[Praising that recollection (anusmṛtyanuśaṃsā):] In this way the recollection of the Buddha is beyond thought [and thus like space (ākāśasama) ], beyond [mental] activity, having the character of being beyond information;beyond what belongs to the ego, beyond mental effort [pertaining to the objects (grāhya) and grasping (grāha) them],not a state of origination and destruction in the parts of personality, spheres or fields of perception;unhindered [and thus penetrating into any time and place in realizing the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātu) which is like empty space];without weak spots;unfixed [as constructed by the insight of attaining and applying (prāptaprayogaprajñā) it after it has been produced], but not non-fixed [since realized through creative insight (bhāvanāprajñā) ], not leaning on [thus not constructing subject and object (grāhyagrāhakanirvikalpa) ], not fixed upon [and thus not apprehending qualities like impermanence, suffering, emptiness or egolessness in the body of the Tathāgata];no objective basis for consciousness of form;no objective basis to be known by feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness;no objective basis for the consciousness characterized by the element of earth;nor the element water, nor the element fire, nor the element wind, no objective basis for the element consciousness;no objective basis for the element consciousness of eye and form;thus not for hearing nor sound, not for nose nor smell, not for tongue nor taste, not for body nor tangibles, not for mind, nor an objective basis for the consciousness related to moments of existence;
Further [to teach its rejection of errors (viparyāsaprahāṇanirdeśa)], this recollection of the Buddha is not dependent on any object,is the non-appearance of all distinguishing marks;is beyond activity consisting in action [of speech], mental activity and movements [of body];is not originating from what has been seen, heard, imagined or comprehended;is not following from that which is characterized by all the the abilities [of the disciples, faith (śraddhā) and so on, by means of which deliverance is attained] and deliverance [the extinction (nirvāṇa) of the disciples, which one does not fall into if one has emptiness (śūnyatā) in mind];is not born again from one moment to another;is appeasement of all thought-constructions and imaginations;is having done away with the mistakes of attachment and aversion;is getting rid of that which is characterized as the cause [of vices (kleśa), namely the view of a self (ātmadṛṣṭi) ];is having cut off [constructing, and thus not] holding on to any extremes, past, future or present;is brilliant as it is not imputed [with thought-constructed concepts of the existence of objects and a subject grasping the objects (grāhyagrākabhāvanirvikalpa) ];is beyond enjoyment since it is undifferentiated [in mind], is beyond pleasure [in body] through not enjoying the taste [of meditation (dhyāna) ];is without burning desire as it is originally in peace;is characterized as deliverance since all its effort has disappeared;[that absolute reality (dharmadhātu) ] is without body since it is without [obstructive (sapratigha) ] form, is not felt being beyond feelings, is without knots being not tied [to grasping the distinguishing marks of objects], is not composite since it is beyond composing powers, is characterized as beyond information as it is beyond consciousness,is beyond clinging since it is without grasping [that is, no mental effort concerned with distinguishing marks (nimittamanasikāra), an error of concentration (samādhidoṣa) ], [but, nevertheless,] it is beyond abandonment since it does not do away with anything [but cultivating the thing itself (tattvabhāvanā) ];is not dependent since it is without basis;is not fixed [and thus attached to anything] as it is beyond feeling;it is unchanging as it is unborn;it is not included among the moments of existence connected with any recollection or mental effort, thought or things thought-related;unaffected [that is, beyond rivalry (parasparaspardhā), since there is no competition in absolute reality (viśuddhadharmadhātuspardhāpratidvaṃdvābhāvatvāt) ];beyond grasping;not on fire [with vices (kleśa) ];completely appeased;originally unborn and distinguished through unbornness;united to total reality [in the way that the recollection of the Buddha and total reality have the same character (ekalakṣaṇa) ], being the same with no difference similar to the homogeneity of open space;transcending the ways of eye and form, and likewise transcending the ways of hearing and sound, nose and smell, tongue and taste, mind and moments of existence.
[Attainment of the fruit of that concentration (tatsamādhiphalaprāpti):] Those bodhisattvas attain that kind of recollection of the Buddha.As soon as they have attained it they attain unhindered knowledge of all moments of existence [that is the knowledge of omniscience (sarvajñajñāna) ], and they preserve what the awakened Lord has spoken [by conventional truth (saṃvṛtitas) ], they do not forget it, but do not remember it either [in the highest meaning (paramārthatas) those moments of existence perish as only informative concepts (prajñaptimātra) as they are empty (śūnya) and because they have no real existence (abhāvatvāt) ], they find the well decided meaning of all words;
Śāradvatīputra, the Tathāgata worthy of offerings, the fully awakened Samantabhadra does not, as here, teach right view in such a way that listening to others is a [necessary] condition, or that thorough mental effort concerning oneself is a [necessary] cause; those bodhisattvas, Śāradvatīputra, as soon as they see that Tathāgata, fulfil the six perfections according to their well decided meanings.
Why?Giving up attachment to distinguishing marks of form is the perfection of giving;Putting an end to distinguishing marks of form [and thus not adopting bad behaviour] is the perfection of morality;The state of things when all distinguishing marks of form have perished is the perfection of tolerance [that is the tolerance that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti) ];Seeing things as apart from distinguishing marks of form is the perfection of vigour [being eagerness to see the essential emptiness of form];Not letting thought disperse itself among the distinguishing marks of form is the perfection of meditation.And no activity of discursive thought among distinguishing marks of form is the perfection of insight.
Thus those bodhisattvas fulfil the six perfections as soon as they see that Lord, the Tathāgata worthy of offerings, the fully awakened Samantabhadra, and they get the prophecy connected with tolerating that all moments of existence are unborn;
The Buddha-fields like the one of that Lord, the Tathāgata Samantabhadra, the world-sphere “Unblinking”, where such bodhisattvas stay, are exceedingly rare;
g) [Quality of demonstrating great powers (mahānubhāvasaṃdarśanasaṃpad):] Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra addressed himself to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati and the other bodhisattvas: – Sons of good family, it is really a great attainment that you may see the Lord Tathāgata Samantabhadra, those bodhisattvas and that world-sphere Unblinking. Akṣayamati said: – Reverend Śāradvatīputra, do you also wish to see the world-sphere Unblinking, the Lord Tathāgata Samantabhadra, those arrays of flowers and those bodhisattvas? Śāradvatīputra said: – Son of good family, I will see it for the sake of increasing the potentialities for the good in the entire assembly here.
Then, at that moment, the bodhisattva Akṣayamati entered the concentration called “The Display of all Buddha-fields”. And then, as soon as he had entered it, the entire assembly and the elder Śāradvatīputra saw the world-sphere Unblinking, (p. 18) the Lord Tathāgata worthy of offerings, the fully awakened Samantabhadra, those arrays of flower and those bodhisattvas. Seeing them they all got up from their respective seats, and joining the palms of their hands they paid homage to the Lord Tathāgata worthy of offerings, the fully awakened Samantabhadra and those bodhisattvas.
Then, by the power of the Buddha [Śākyamuni] and the magic of the bodhisattva Akṣayamati, there appeared in their right hands flower-buds, never seen before, never heard of before, fragrant, multicoloured, beautiful to behold, colourful and pleasing. They threw them towards the east, where the Lord Tathāgata worthy of offerings, the fully awakened Samantabhadra stayed. Those flower-buds cast by them appeared in that Buddha-field, and having been sprinkled on that Tathāgata worthy of offerings, they filled the whole world-sphere with flowers. And the bodhisattvas living in that world-sphere asked the Lord Tathāgata worthy of offerings, the fully awakened Samantabhadra: – Lord, where does the rain of such beautiful flowers fall from?
That Lord said: – This, sons of good family, is because the bodhisattva Akṣayamati has arrived in the world-sphere Enduring, the Buddha-field of the Lord Śākyamuni, to see that Lord Tathāgata Śākyamuni, to honour him, give him offerings, pay him respect and listen to his religion, whereupon the bodhisattvas who have gathered in that world-sphere from the ten directions have scattered those flowers. And that Lord Tathāgata Śākyamuni is explaining the exposition of religion called “A chapter of the Great Collection”, and living beings whose numbers are beyond measure are about to comprehend religion;
They said: – Lord, how far from here is that world-sphere where the Tathāgata Śākyamuni stays? That Lord said: – There is a world-sphere called “Enduring”, which lies west of this Buddha-field, past as many Buddha-fields from here as there are dustlike grains of sand in ten Gaṅgā-rivers. There a Tathāgata, worthy of offerings, fully awakened, Śākyamuni by name stays, remains, and lives on, teaching religion. They said: – Let us have a look, Lord, at that world-sphere Enduring, that Lord Tathāgata worthy of offerings, the fully awakened Śākyamuni and those bodhisattvas.
Then, at that moment, the Tathāgata Samantabhadra, worthy of offerings, the fully awakened emitted such a light from his body, that by that light, once it had penetrated all those Buddha-fields, this world-sphere Enduring, the Lord Tathāgata Śākyamuni and these bodhisattvas were seen by his own bodhisattvas. When they saw them, they all got up from their respective seats and joined the palms of their hands, and bowing to the Lord Tathāgata Śākyamuni and these bodhisattvas they said: – Lord, whence have so many bodhisattvas gathered, crowding this world-sphere to the point where one could not even insert a tip of hair between them?
That Lord said: – These bodhisattvas, sons of good family, have gathered from immeasurable Buddha-fields in the ten directions to hear about religion.
III. Root of Religion:
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra addressed himself to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati:– Why, son of good family, is your name “Imperishable Intelligence”? Akṣayamati said: – The name “Imperishable Intelligence” is the outcome of having all moments of existence as object. For what reason? Because of the imperishability of all moments of existence? Śāradvatīputra said:– Be inspired in your speech, son of good family, on the subject of the bodhisattvas’ teaching of the imperishability of all moments of existence;
1st Imperishable: Generating the Thought of Awakening.
Akṣayamati said: – Generating the thought of awakening for the first time, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is also imperishable.For what reason? Since it is unadulterated; that thought is generated as unadulterated with any vices [and thus 1. always good (nityakuśala) ],That thought is generated as beyond any adulteration since it has no desire for other religious ways [2. not relinquishing its nature (aparityaktasvabhāva) ];that thought is generated as firm since it is not corrupted by any opponent [3. not giving up its nature (anutsṛṣṭasvabhāva) ];that thought is generated as unbreakable by any of the Evil Ones [4. fulfilling its proper actions (svakarmakṛt) ];that thought is generated as steady because of [being the cause of] the attainment of all roots of the good;that thought is generated as permanent [and thus not getting into the power of the vices of existence (saṃsārakleśa) ], since it discerns the impermanence in all conditioned things;that thought is generated as immovable since it is [the basis for] the attainment of the qualities of a Buddha;that thought is generated as uncrushable since it is separated from any wrong practice;that thought is generated as well fixed [always in concentration (samāhita) ] since it is unwavering;that thought is generated as beyond comparison since it has no contrast;that thought is generated as adamantine since it pierces all moments of existence;that thought is generated as boundless since it accumulates immeasurable quantities of merit;that thought is generated as the same [being friendliness and the absence of aversion (maitryapratigha) ] towards the intentions of all beings;that thought is generated as undifferentiated since it sets nothing apart [giving up concepts of good and bad, high and low, etc.];that thought is generated as pure since it is essentially undefiled;that thought is generated as immaculate since it is connected with the splendour of insight;that thought is generated as deep meditation [not swerving into something else] since it never gives up its determination;that thought is generated as great since its friendliness is similar to the expanse of the sky [the friendliness which originates from that thought fills living beings whose number is as endless as the expanse of the sky];that thought is generated as extensive [without hindrance] since it gives all living beings an opportunity [in fulfilling their intentions and hopes by means of the five supernormal knowledges (pañcābhijñā) which originate from that thought of awakening];that thought is generated as unobstructed since it is bent towards unattached knowledge [by the supernormal knowledge of cessation of impurities (āsravakṣayābhijñā) ];that thought is generated in accordance with [birth in] every [state of existence] since its great compassion never ceases [with great compassion (mahākaruṇā) the bodhisattva always has beings in the three worlds of desire (traidhātukasattva) in mind, and though he attains the states of meditation (dhyānaprāpta) he is nevertheless born again in the worlds of desire (kāmadhātu) ];[but even though he is born that way, he does not give up meditation, thus] that thought is generated as never ceasing since it is the knowledge of how to transform [into awakening];that thought is generated as something desirable [even being born in the world of desire] since it is praised by the omniscient;that thought is generated as something to be admired since it enters other ways [being the basis also of disciples (śrāvaka) and isolated buddhas (pratyekabuddha) ];that thought is generated as something not seen among the things usually seen by living beings;that thought is generated as the seed of all qualities of a Buddha;that thought is generated as unbreakable by any moment of existence;that thought is generated as the foundation of all states of happiness;that thought is generated as adorned with [in being the cause (hetu) of] the accumulation of merit;that thought is generated as attained through accumulation of insight;that thought is generated as prosperous through the accumulation of generosity;that thought is generated as the outcome of vows through the accumulation of morality;that thought is generated as hard to overcome through the accumulation of tolerance;that thought is generated as hard to conquer through the accumulation of vigour;that thought is generated as having the essential character of peace through the accumulation of meditation;that thought is generated as unhindered through the accumulation of insight;that thought is generated as without harm through the accumulation of great friendliness;that thought is generated as stable and firmly rooted through the accumulation of great compassion;that thought is generated as established in joy, happiness and delight through the accumulation of great joy;that thought is generated as disturbed neither by pleasure nor suffering through the accumulation of great equanimity;that thought is generated as blessed with the powerful presence of all Buddhas [viz. their power (anubhāva), special intentions (abhiprāya) and favours (parigraha) ];that thought is generated as the unbrokenness of the principle of the teachings since it keeps the succession of the three jewels unbroken;that thought is generated as praised in the congregations throughout the Buddha-fields in the ten directions.
[5. Always bringing fruit (nityaphalaparigraha):] Is there any perishability, reverend Śāradvatīputra, in the thought of omniscience [that thought of awakening which is the cause of the knowledge of omniscience (sarvajñajñānahetu), or, that thought of awakening that in its essence is not different from omniscience] generated thus?
Śāradvatīputra said: – Not at all, son of good family, he would hold that space would perish who holds that such a thought of omniscience could perish.
Akṣayamati said: – The mind of the Tathāgata [namely the knowledge of omniscience (sarvajñajñāna) ], reverend Śāradvatīputra, is imperishable; that thought of awakening is generated as its root, which is why it is imperishable [when the fruit (phala) is imperishable, its cause (hetu) is also imperishable];
The heaps of morality, concentration, insight, liberation and the vision of the knowledge of liberation of the Tathāgata, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are imperishable; that thought of awakening is generated as their root, which is why it is imperishable;
The meditations, liberations, concentrations and states of meditation of the Tathāgata, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are imperishable; that thought of awakening is generated as their root, which is why it is imperishable;
The generosity, morality, tolerance, vigour, meditation and insight of the Tathāgata, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are imperishable; that thought of awakening is generated as their root, which is why it is imperishable;
The friendliness, compassion, joy and equanimity of the Tathāgata, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are imperishable; that thought of awakening is generated as their root, which is why it is imperishable;
The ten powers, four kinds of absence of fear and eighteen peculiar qualities of the Tathāgata, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are imperishable; that thought of awakening is generated as their root, which is why it is imperishable;
In short, reverend Śāradvatīputra, all the qualities of a Buddha are imperishable; that thought of awakening is generated as their root, which is why it is imperishable;
[6. The cause never comes to an end (aparikṣīṇahetu):] Since it keeps the succession of the three jewels unbroken it is imperishable;since the sphere of living beings is imperishable it is imperishable [having the endless sphere of all living beings as its object (ālambana) ];since it is bent upon knowledge of that [fact that the sphere of living beings is imperishable] it is imperishable;since it is discerning the mental behaviour of all beings it is imperishable;since it is not to break any of one’s former vows it is imperishable;since it is transformed into the unconditioned it is imperishable;since it matures beings for the unconditioned it is imperishable;since its knowledge of cessation, its knowledge of unbornness is imperishable, it is imperishable;[and, 7. according to the highest truth (paramārthatas),] since it does not arise nor disappear it is imperishable;since it is [the cause of] complete comprehension of the fact that all moments of existence are originally imperishable it is imperishable.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattva’s imperishable thought of awakening.
IV. The Fruit Thereof
2nd Imperishable: Intention.
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ intention is also imperishable. Why?
[The imperishability of intention is characterized by ten properties (lakṣaṇa), 1. the property of purity (viśuddhalakṣaṇa):] That intention, then, is not artificial since it is not made up [so as to hope for retribution, having a motive, it is not done for the sake of anything else. Having no motive (ahetuka), it is the cause of imperishability in great awakening (mahābodhyakṣayatāhetu), and thus, having that essence, it should be known as imperishable];not made up since it is without hypocrisy [having no view to others with the intention of cheating or deceiving them];without hypocrisy since it is right understanding [hypocrisy and pretence arise from perverted viewpoints];right understanding since it is without pretence;without pretence since it is pure [having subdued the habits (vāsanā) of hypocrisy and pretence].[2. Property of penetration (praveśalakṣaṇa):] It is pure since it is straight;straight since it is not crooked;not crooked since it is clear [in meaning which is to be taught];clear since it is not uneven;not uneven since it is firm;[3. Property of not turning back (avivartyalakṣaṇa):] It is firm since it is not broken [by anger when hurt];not broken because it is stable [in practising the good of others]; stable since it is unwavering [in promise];unwavering since it is not dependent [on material things, or even the impermanence in the five parts of vices in the personality (kleśaskandha) ];not dependent since it is not attached to that;[4. Property of expectation (spṛhālakṣaṇa):] It is not attached [to material things, seeking joy transcending the world] since it is totally different;totally different since it is irreproachable;irreproachable since it is doing good actions;doing good actions since it is not blamed in secrecy [as inconsistent, entering both the way to extinction and the worldly way (saṃsāranirvāṇamārgapratipanna), sometimes practising good (kuśalacarita) and sometimes practising bad (akuśalacarita) ];not blamed in secrecy because it is free from remorse;[5. Property of unpervertedness (aviparītalakṣaṇa):] It is free from remorse since it is without distress;without distress since it is true,true since it is not breaking one’s word;not breaking one’s word since it is doing what has been promised;doing what has been promised since it is well done;well done since it is without reprehension [in not inducing remorse in another by saying his action is bad];[6. Property of not forgetting (amuṣitasmṛtilakṣaṇa):] It is without reprehension since it is unerring;unerring since it is steady;steady since it is not falling back [from the incomparable awakening];not falling back since it has regard for living beings [in making the good of others more important than one’s own];[7. Property of purity of cause (hetuviśuddhilakṣaṇa):] It is regard for living beings since it is rooted in great compassionṭ Tg ci 45b7-46a1 ::: rgyu rnam par dag pa’i mtshan ñid kyaṅ rnam pa drug ste, sñiṅ rje chen po’i rtsa ba daṅ, sbyor ba mi gtoṅ ba daṅ, sbyor ba sgrub pa daṅ, gźan la phan pa’i rgyu ma yin pa’i bde ba mi dgos pa daṅ, gźan la phan pa’i rgyus bde ba ñid du gyur pa daṅ, sems can gyi don byed pas bde ba’i don du gyur pa’o.æææ46a1-3de la sñiṅ rje chen po’i rtsa ba yin pas na, sems can la lta ba’o źes bya bas sñiṅ rje chen po’i rtsa ba bstan te, byaṅ chub sems dpa’i bsam pa rnam par dag pa ste, sñiṅ rje chen po’i rtsa ba daṅ rgyur gyur pa’i phyir sems can gyi don bya ba la lta ba’o. de la rnam pa gsum gyi phyir sñiṅ rje chen po źes bya ste, rgyu che ba ni bsod nams daṅ ye śes kyi tshogs dpag tu med pa bsags pa las byuṅ ba’i phyir ro; dmigs pa chen po ni stoṅ gsum gyi stoṅ chen po’i sems can thams cad la dmigs pa’i phyir ro; rgyud chen po ni sñiṅ rje chen po de ñan thos daṅ raṅ saṅs rgyas kyi sems kyi rgyud la mi ’byuṅ gi, de bźin gśegs pa daṅ byaṅ chub sems dpa’ rnams kyi rgyud la ’byuṅ ba’i phyir ro.rooted in great compassion since it is indefatigable;indefatigable since it is the knowledge of the way to bring beings to maturity;knowing the way to bring beings to maturity since it is not seeking self-centered pleasure;not seeking self-centered pleasure since it is not hoping for recompense;not hoping for recompense since it is unattached to material things;[8. Property of purity of object (ārambaṇaviśuddhilakṣaṇa):] It is unattached to material things since it is confidence in religion;confidence in religion since it is regard for weak living beings;regard for weak living beings since it is a protection;protection since it is a refuge;a refuge since it is the principal aim; and the principal aim since it is without vices;[9. Property of purity of mental effort (manasikāraviśuddhilakṣaṇa):] It is without vices since it has well understood [that which things are (dharmāṇāṃ tattvam) ];having well understood since it is beyond abuse;beyond abuse since it is good intention;good intention since it is not anything in particular;not anything in particuar since it is completely pure;[10. Property of purity of viewpoint (dṛṣṭiviśuddhilakṣaṇa):] It is completely pure since it is very white;very white because of inner stainlessness [in being without the stain which is the error of imagining distinguishing marks (nimittavikalpa) of thought (citta) ];inner stainlessness because of outer purity, [he does not give up existence (saṃsāra) – since understanding outer moments of existence as empty (śūnya), outer moments of existence are pure];outer purity because of complete purity in all aspects.
That intention of the bodhisattvas, reverend Śāradvatīputra, should be seen as [pure] for the sake of getting rid of envy [in one’s own continuity of thoughts (cittasaṃtana) ], but intention should be seen as imperishable through maturing envious beings [in having endless numbers of envious living beings as the object (anantamātsaryasattvālambanatvāt) ];
That intention should be seen as for the sake of getting rid of the stain of bad morality, but intention should be seen as imperishable through maturing beings of bad morality;
That intention should be seen as for the sake of getting rid of ill-will, harshness and hatred, but intention should be seen as imperishable through maturing beings with hatred in their thoughts;
That intention should be seen as for the sake of getting rid of sloth, but intention should be seen as imperishable through maturing slothful beings;
That intention should be seen as for the sake of getting rid of lack of concentration, but intention should be seen as imperishable through maturing unconcentrated beings;
That intention should be seen as for the sake of getting rid of bad insight, but intention should be seen as imperishable through maturing beings of bad insight;
Thus, reverend Śāradvatīputra, [to teach purity of intention (āśayaśuddhi) as contrasted with imperishability of intention (āśayākṣayatā) in short, it is said] that intention should be seen as for the sake of getting rid of all bad moments of existence of all living beings, but it should be seen as imperishable through bringing all beings to strive for the good;
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable intention.
3rd Imperishable: Practice.
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ practice is imperishable since their intention is imperishable. Why?
[1. Where practice is imperishable (yatra prayogo ’kṣayaḥ):] The intention of generosity is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice, while his practice is the appearance that he gives away all he has got;
The intention of moral discipline is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice, while his practice is the appearance of taking upon himself moral discipline, training, the qualities of asceticism and penance;
The intention of tolerance is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice, while his practice is the appearance of no aggressive thoughts towards any being;
The intention of vigour is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice, while his action is the appearance of having all roots of good as the basis;
The intention of meditation is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice, while his practice is the appearance of purification of his meditation;
The intention of insight is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice, while his practice is the appearance of purification of what he has learned;
[2. The means by which practice is imperishable (yena prayogo ’kṣayaḥ):] The intention of friendliness, compassion, joy and equanimity is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice, while his practice is the appearance of bringing benefits and happiness for living beings, of joy and confidence in religion, and of getting rid of aversion and attachment;
[3. Where established practice is imperishable (yatra sthitaḥ prayogo ’kṣayaḥ):] The intention concerning the body is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is purifying the threefold vow of bodily deeds;the intention concerning speech is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is giving up the four kinds of sin in speech;the intention concerning the mind is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is the absence of covetousness, aversion and wrong views;
[4. How practice is imperishable (yathā prayogo ’kṣayaḥ):] The intention concerning what he has heard [sūtras and so on, his learning] is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since he has no teacher’s secrecy concerning religion;
[5. Why practice is imperishable (yasmāt prayogo ’kṣayaḥ):] The intention of no teacher’s secrecy concerning religion is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is the practice of [generating] the thought of omniscience;the intention of [generating] the thought of omniscience is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is making other living beings adopt the thought of awakening;the intention of making other living beings adopt the thought of awakening is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is bringing [living beings] in touch with the roots of good;the intention of practice concerned with the roots of good is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is transforming into awakening;the intention to transform into awakening is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is attaining all the qualities of a Buddha;the intention of attaining all the qualities of a Buddha is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is grasping true religion;grasping true religion is the bodhisattva’s imperishable practice since it is admitting one’s wrongdoings;the intention to admit one’s wrongdoings is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is to confess one’s sins;the intention to confess one’s sins is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is to rejoice in all merit;the intention to rejoice in all merit is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is to collect immeasurable accumulations of merit;the intention to collect immeasurable accumulations of merit is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is seeking all Buddhas;the intention to request [teachings from] all Buddhas is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is supporting true religion;the intention to support true religion is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is the deed of a good man [that is, of a bodhisattva or Buddha, whose action is to make others adopt true religion];the intention of the deed of a good man is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is freeing others from their burden;the intention of freeing others from their burden is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is never to take off the strong armour [of vigour (vīrya) ];the intention never to take off the strong armour [of vigour (vīrya) ] is the bodhisattva’s imperishability of practice since it is carrying out the duties of all beings;
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, these four are the bodhisattva’s imperishable practices. What four?
1) The imperishability of practice being the thought of awakening; 2) the imperishability of practice being explanation, the gift of religion; 3) the imperishability of practice to bring beings to maturity; 4) the imperishability of practice to accumulate roots of the good; these are the four imperishable practices.
Again, there are four imperishable practices. What four? 1) The imperishability of practice which consists in tirelessness in conforming to the qualities of asceticism and penance when living in the wilderness; 2) the imperishability of practice which consists in tirelessness in amassing accumulations of merit and knowledge; 3) the imperishability of practice which consists in tirelessness in the quest for learning; 4) the imperishability of practice which consists in tirelessness in knowing how to transform into awakening; these are the four imperishable practices.
Again, there are four imperishable practices. What four? 1) The imperishability of practice which consists in understanding numbers [writing, calculation and seals (lipigaṇanāmudrādijñānam) ]; 2) the imperishability of practice which consists in understanding weights [measures of capacity and weights of gold and silver (droṇakarṣāditulanājñānam) ]; 3) the imperishability of practice which consists in understanding examination [of the quality of things like clothes and goods (vastraratnādijñānam) ]; 4) the imperishability of practice which consists in understanding through inspection [of bodily qualities of men, elephants, horses etc. (puruṣahastyaśvādyaṅgamaṇividyādijñānam) ]; these are the four imperishable practices.
Again, there are four imperishable practices. What four? 1) The imperishability of practice which consists in understanding the cause of impurity; 2) the imperishability of practice which consists in understanding the cause of purity; 3) the imperishability of practice which consists in proclaiming the cause of impurity; 4) the imperishability of practice which consists in proclaiming the qualities and advantages of purity; these are four imperishable practices.
Again, there are four imperishable practices. What four? 1) The imperishability of practice which consists in investigating the parts of personality [as being like an illusion (māyopama) ]; 2) the imperishability of practice which consists in investigating the spheres of perception [as being like an empty city (śūnyagrāmopama) ]; 3) the imperishability of practice which consists in investigating the fields of perception [as being like snake poison (yathāśiviṣa) ]; 4) the imperishability of practice which consists in investigating dependent origination [all things arise from causes and conditions (hetupratyaya) ]; these are four imperishable practices.
Again, there are four imperishable practices. What four? 1) The imperishability of practice which consists in explaining that conditions are impermanent; 2) the imperishability of practice which consists in explaining that conditions are suffering; 3) the imperishability of practice which consists in explaining that all moments of existence are selfless; 4) the imperishability of practice which consist in explaining the enjoyment of peace in extinction; these are four imperishable practices.
In short, reverend Śāradvatīputra, all the bodhisattva’s practices are inclined towards omniscience, directed towards omniscience, and bent upon omniscience. And since omniscience is imperishable [being like open space (ākāśasama) ], therefore all the practices of the bodhisattvas are also imperishable.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable practice.
4th Imperishable: Determination.
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the determination of the bodhisattvas is also imperishable.
[1. To show that determination is essentially imperishable (svabhāvākṣayatādeśanārtham); and in what the imperishability consists (yākṣayatā), it is said:]Why? Because it rests upon all the roots of the good;whatever the bodhisattva thinks ultimately rests upon the roots of good because of his determination.It is the determination to pass on since it is to stay on one stage after another;;the determination to cross over since it is going to a different state [beyond the threefold world (traidhātuka-) ];the highest determination since it is distinguished [from the determination of disciples and isolated buddhas, as that of the isolated buddhas is distinguished from that of the disciples];the distinguished determination because of [gradually] grasping [superior qualities (adhikaguṅa) being] different moments of existence;the determination having all the qualities of a Buddha clearly in view;the determination resting upon moments of existence distinguished [from earlier stages of development];the determination to carry through all undertakings;the persevering determination because of indefatigability in perseverance;the determination of perfected vows because of fulfilling the vows;the unassailable determination since one has only oneself as companion [when realizing incomparable awakening (anuttarabodhi) ];the determination on the stage of being well trained [like a horse] because of the absence of unruliness;the determination on the stage of being disciplined because of nobility;the unmixed determination because of non-contamination with the vices of untrained beings;the determination of giving gifts hard to give because of giving even the head, the best part of the body, the determination of morality hard to practise because of protection for the immoral, the determination of tolerance hard to endure because of putting up with the faults of weak beings, the determination of vigour hard to practise because of giving up the awakening of disciples and isolated buddhas even while having it at hand, the determination of meditation hard to practise because of not tasting meditation [which is the highest pleasure in the world], the determination of insight hard to practise because of not deriding the accumulation of any root of the good;the determination to carry through any practice undertaken because of completing the duties of all beings;the determination free from conceit, pride, haughtiness, self-conceit, self-esteem, pride of modesty and illusory pride because of discerning with knowledge;the determination of regarding all beings as worthy of gifts because of not hoping for recompense;the determination of fearlessness because of understanding the deep religion of the Buddhas;the determination to go to a different state because of progressing by means of powers [like insight (prajñā) and so on];the determination to never be fainthearted because of helping those carrying burdens [of four kinds, that of the parts of personality (skandhabhāra), vices (kleśabhāra), promises (pratijñābhāra) or vigour (vīryabhāra) ];the imperishable determination because of constant alertness [to maturing living beings and the qualities of a Buddha (sattvabuddhadharmaparipākāya) ];
[2. To show that its action is imperishable (kāryākṣayatādeśanārtham), and how it is imperishable (yathākṣayatā):]Further, determination is said to be kindness to [non-human] beings, friendliness to living beings, thoughts for the weal of the noble, care for the not noble, respect for the masters;protection for the unprotected, a refuge for those without refuge, an island for the shipwrecked, an ideal for those without ideals, friendship to the friendless;straightness to the crooked, correctness to the unruly, absence of fraud to the fraudulent, absence of trickery to the dissemblers;gratitude to the ungrateful, thankfulness to the harmful, help to the unhelpful, truth to the mistaken;humility to the stubborn, no reproach to the virtuous, not proclaiming the mistakes of others, protection to those who behave wrongly, not seeing faults in any practice of ability in skilful means, homage to all worthy of offerings;adequate obedience to admonitions; happiness in mind at instructions and admonitions;respecting hermits;no desire for gain, honour and fame;no regard for one’s own body or life [in seeking true religion and doing the good for living beings];no hypocrisy because of pure determination;no boasting because of restraint in speech;no threats [and thus using force (balāt) ] because of contentment with what one has;responsiveness [being freed from grasping for bad places, staying concentrated] because of no impurity of thought;inclination towards existence because of accumulation of all roots of the good;enduring any suffering [giving up thought-constructions (vikalpa) concerned with hard and easy] because of concern for all beings;
[3. To show that its cause is imperishable (hetvakṣayatādeśanārtham), and that by which it is imperishable (yair akṣayatā):] Thus the determinations of those good men are all imperishable; all vices of existence cannot make them perish since they are supported by all merit; since they are the nourishment of all beings; since by them one attains imperishable knowledge [or, omniscience (sarvajñajñāna) ];
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable determination.
V. Bringing About What is Beneficial to Oneself and Others
5th Imperishable: Generosity.
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra spoke these words to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati: – Is there, son of good family, any other imperishability of the bodhisattvas?
Akṣayamati said: – There is, reverend Śāradvatīputra. The generosity of the bodhisattvas is also imperishable. Why? It is immeasurable. Reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ enjoyment of generosity is immeasurable.
[1. Generosity comprising the fruit (phalaparigṛhīta): a. outer gifts (bāhyadāna):]He gives food to those desirous of food so as to display [the immeasurable (amita) ] life [of the Tathāgata], eloquence [never interrupted (apratihata) ], pleasure [of concentration and states of meditation (samādhisamāpatti) ], strength [unthinkable (acintya) ] and complexion;he gives drink to those desirous of drink to get rid of the thirst of all vices;he gives vehicles to those desirous of vehicles to collect all kinds of things bringing happiness and welfare;he gives clothes to those desirous of clothes for the sake of modesty and bashfulness, and to purify a golden complexion;he gives lamps to those desirous of lamps so as to see with the divine sight of the Tathāgata;he gives music to those desirous of music to purify the divine hearing of the Tathāgata;he gives perfume and unguents to those desirous of perfume and unguents to be anointed with morality, learning and concentration;he gives garlands to those desirous of garlands to obtain the flowers of remembrance, eloquence, and the limbs of awakening;he gives aromatic powder to those desirous of aromatic powder to attain a pleasant smell of the body;he gives all kinds of taste to those desirous of any [of the six kinds of] taste to bring about the character of the true man which consists in having excellent taste;he gives houses to those desirous of houses to make houses, refuges, places to go to and places of protection;he gives places of rest to those desirous of places of rest [so they will enjoy the pleasure of sleep] to get rid of all hindrances [by the resting-places of the eight liberations (vimokṣa), or of the three gates of liberation (vimokṣamukha) ] and attain the abodes of the gods [that is, the four states of meditation (dhyāna) ] and that of Brahmā [the four immeasurable qualities (apramāṇa) ], and the Tathāgatas’ place of rest;he gives seats to those desirous of seats to attain the adamantine seat, the place of awakening of each of the threefold thousand great thousand worlds;he gives necessities of life to those desirous of the necessities of life to complete the necessities for awakening;he gives medicine to the sick, those desirous of medicine, to complete the happiness which is the ambrosia of agelessness and deathlessness [that is, extinction (nirvāṇa) ];the bodhisattvas’ gift when letting female and male slaves go is to complete self-originated knowledge which is dependent only on itself, in its own power;the bodhisattvas’ gift when giving away all kinds of riches, gold, silver, jewels, pearls, lapis lazuli, conches, crystals and corals is to complete the thirty-two characteristics of a great man;the bodhisattvas’ gift when giving away different kinds of ornaments is to complete the eighty marks of beauty;head-jewels and diadems are the bodhisattvas’ gift to obtain the invisible crown of the head;(p. 31) vehicles, horses, elephants, carts and foot-men are the bodhisattvas’ gift to complete the great way;the bodhisattvas’ gift when giving away gardens, palaces, meditation-groves and monasteries is to complete the multitude of limbs of meditation;the bodhisattvas’ gift when giving away their dear sons, daughters and wives [namely the highest joy and beauty of the world] is for the sake of waking up to the joy of incomparable complete awakening [which is omniscience];the bodhisattvas’ gift when giving away riches and grain, treasuries and granaries is to fill the treasuries and granaries of true religion;the bodhisattvas’ gift when giving away sovereignty over villages, towns, market-towns, royal cities, capitals, over the central continents or the four continents, is to go to the place of awakening of the king of religion, which is in all respects excellent;the bodhisattvas’ gift when giving away all pleasure, joy and amusement is to attain joy and confidence in religion.
[b. Inner gifts (adhyātmadāna):] The feet are the bodhisattvas’ gift so as to go to the place of awakening on the foot of true religion;the palm of the hand is the bodhisattvas’ gift so as to give the hand of true religion to all beings;the ears and nose are the bodhisattvas’ gift so as to attain unimpaired faculties;the eyes are the bodhisattvas’ gift so that he with regard to all beings may attain the unhindered sight of a Buddha, the sight of religion;the head, the best part of the body, is the bodhisattvas’ gift so as to attain the highest knowledge, omniscience, distinct from the threefold world;the bodhisattvas’ gift when giving away flesh and blood is to nourish a body without strength [namely that of the five parts of the personality (skandha) created by action and vices (karmakleśa) ] so it attains strength [as the absolute body (dharmakāya) ];the bodhisattvas’ gift when giving away the skin is to purify a golden complexion, with the skin soft and shining;bones and marrow are the bodhisattvas’ gift so as to attain the body of a Buddha, unbreakable and firm as adamantine, strong as that of Nārāyāṇa.
[2. The pure nature (viśuddhasvabhāva) of generosity in rejecting contrary faults (vipakṣahāṇi):]Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, there is no gift of the bodhisattvas for the sake of seeking perverted pleasure;no gift entailing harm to living beings [like killing someone who is ill to save him from suffering, teaching the way to kill living beings, or offerings (yajña) involving the killing of animals];no gift producing conceit;no gift accompanied by fear, worries or shame;no gift that is not given once it has been offered;no gift smaller than promised;no gift of bad things when good things are available;no gift without determination;no gift with falsehood or fraud;no artificial gifts;no gift for the sake of getting a certain result, for the sake of frivolity;no gift with intention leading to bad conduct;no gift with deluded intentions [not believing in the action and its maturation (karmavipāka) ];no gift with the intention of seeking a way [out of dangers];no gift with perverted intentions [believing in permanence (nityādyabhiniveśa), etc.];no gift without faith [or attitude of joy];no gift not given with joy;no gift to which one is attached;no gift because of compliance;no gift recognizing a difference between living beings;no gift seeking out a special recipient [to get the maximum return in merit];(p. 32) no gift despising any being as unworthy of gifts [as it gives no merit in return];no gift accompanied by praise of the moral and blame of the immoral;no gift for the sake of retribution;no gift for the sake of renown, fame and praise;no gift to exalt oneself and deprecate others;no gift with subsequent annoyance;no gift with regret;no gift with remorse;no gift which is irksome [to the welcomed supplicant by not giving it to him at once];no gift with another hope;no gift with deprecatory utterances [asserting that the supplicant has benefitted in this or that way];no gift with the hope that a good result for oneself should be entailed;no gift measured out;no gift producing rage, aversion, delusion or harmfulness;no gift troublesome to the one asking [because of giving too much to someone desirous of food or someone who is ill];no gift with mocking and derision;no gift with hostility;no gift [already] thrown away;no gift not treated with respect;no gift not from one’s own hands;no gift not given always;no gift without serenity;no gift prompted by others [thinking: “When this person gives, I must also give”];no gift with special limitations;no gift less than appointed;no gift not in accordance with the original resolution;no gift thinking: “That being is no worthy receiver”;no gift with contempt for the small;no gift with pride because of the magnificent;no gift with the wrong purpose [not transformed (pariṇāmita) into incomparable awakening (anuttarabodhi) ];[and thus] no gift wishing [a special kind of] birth;no gift for the sake of enjoyment of beauty, pleasure and power [having been born as a human];no gift with the wish of being born as the king of the gods, the highest god, a protector of the world or in the group of all the gods;no gift which is transformed into the way of disciples or isolated buddhas;no gift wishing to be a crown-prince and to have the power of a king;no gift [of] which [the result] disappears in one lifetime;no gift [thinking:] “It is enough [with one lifetime], further giving is not needed”;no gift not transformed into the thought of omniscience;no unsuitable gift [as when giving too much food and drink to ascetics, and giving garlic, onion, meat and wine to those who do not eat these things as they think it is not right (pratikūla), thus defiling them];no gift at the wrong time [as when giving to others without first giving to one’s own retinue];no gift of poison [even wine] or swords;no gift [of meat, blood, etc.] that involves the injury of living beings [like the killing of sheep, etc.].[In short], the generosity of the bodhisattvas is not censured by the wise.
[3. Its pure nature (viśuddhasvabhāva) as the adoption of an antidote (pratipakṣaparigraha):][a) Antidote to the worldly (laukikapratipakṣa):] That generosity is accomplished in the form of emptiness, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is pervaded by the absence of distinguishing marks, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is established in the absence of longing for anything, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is transformed into the unconditioned, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is [correctly] undertaken, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is not contaminated by the threefold world, which is why it is imperishable.[b) Antidote of unworldly training (lokottaraśikṣāpratipakṣa):] That generosity has liberation as the outcome, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is the absolute subjugation of all the Evil Ones, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is not mixed up with any of the vices [and cannot perish through its contrary, namely meanness and concepts of self and other (mātsaryaparâtmagrahavipakṣa) ], which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is going to a different state, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is definitely a good deed, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is accumulation of merit on the way to awakening, which is why it is imperishable.[c) Incomparable (anuttara):] That generosity is rightly transformed, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity has liberation as the outcome, it is an ornament of the place of awakening, which is why it is (p. 33) imperishable;that generosity is nourishing all beings, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is boundless, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is beyond decrease, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is not included in anything [neither the side of existence nor that of extinction (saṃsāranirvāṇapakṣa) ] which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is never interrupted [because it is not the case that what has been given in the past is not to be given in the future], which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is abundant, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is not dependent [on the fruit (phala) ], which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is without any [future] basis, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is faultless, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is blameless, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is never subdued [never getting into the power of its contrary, meanness (mātsaryavipakṣa) ], which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is unsurpassed, which is why it is imperishable;that generosity is bent on the knowledge of omniscience, which is why it is imperishable.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable generosity.
6th Imperishable: Morality.
(p. 34) Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra addressed himself to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati: – Well spoken by you, son of good family, was this imperishability of the bodhisattvas’ generosity. May you be inspired, son of good family, on the subject of the imperishability of the bodhisattvas’ morality, as to how the morality of the bodhisattvas becomes imperishable.
Akṣayamati said: – In sixty-five ways, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the bodhisattvas’ mass of pure morality imperishable. What are the sixty-five?
[1. Morality correctly undertaken (samāttaśīla):]1) Not harming any living beings;2) not stealing others’ possessions;3) no desire for others’ wives;4) no lies to any being;5) no slander through being content with one’s own circle of followers;6) no harsh speech through enduring hard words;7) no confused chattering through absence of chattering;8) no cupidity through joy in others’ pleasure;9) no ill-will through tolerating ways of speech involving accusation and slander;10) right view through staying away from the teachings of other teachers;11) trust in the Buddha through no impurity of thought;12) trust in religion as it is the excellent religion teaching the way things are;13) trust in the congregation through joy caused by all groups of saints;14) obedience through respect for

secondary vices (kleśopakleśa) ];61) morality of adequately grasping gentle speech through acting according to instruction;62) morality of bringing living beings to maturity through not giving up the ways of attracting people;63) morality of guarding true religion through not wasting [the seven kinds of noble] riches;64) morality fulfilling all wishes through being originally pure [not adopted initially because of fear of punishment (rājadaṇḍa) or lack of livelihood, but adopted with pure intention (śuddhāśaya) ];65) morality to attain the morality of the Tathāgata through being transformed into that morality;66) morality concerned with the concentrations and states of meditation of the Buddhas through having the same attitude towards all beings;in these sixty-five ways, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the bodhisattvas’ mass of pure morality imperishable.
[2. The morality of the true state of things (dharmatāśīla):]Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, morality is where there is no attribution of a self, an animated being, a life-principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit, a personality, a man, no attribution of a human being;morality is where there is no attribution of form, feeling, perception, formative factors, no attribution of consciousness;morality is where there is no attribution of element of earth, element of water, element of fire, no attribution of element of wind;morality is where there is no attribution of distinguishing marks of the eye, no distinguishing marks of form, nor of hearing or sound, nose or smell, tongue or taste, body or tangibles, no attribution of distinguishing marks of mind, no attribution of distinguishing marks of moments of existence;morality is where there is no attribution of body, speech or mind.
[3. Morality with the essential characteristic of the two ways (dvimārgalakṣaṇaṃ śīlam):]Morality is that which has the essential character of peaceful meditation through one-pointedness [having one object (ālambana) ];morality is that which has the essential character of expanded vision through skill in discerning moments of existence [both their general and individual characteristics (svasāmānyalakṣaṇa) ].
[4. Morality with the essential characteristic of the three gates of liberation (trivimokṣamukhalakṣaṇaṃ śīlam):]Morality is that which is knowledge of emptiness, fully beyond distinguishing marks, not something that can be longed for, not mingled with the threefold world.
[5. The deep morality effected through purification of the contrary to morality (śīlavipakṣaviśuddhigambhīraśīlam):]Morality is that which is tolerance of unbornness, brought about as not conditioned [by vices (kleśa), or by causes and conditions (hetupratyaya) ] and [from understanding moments of existence as] unborn;morality is that which is not made, not active;morality is that which is not born in the beginning, does not perish in the end, does not remain in between;morality is that which is pure thought, not dependent on consciousness, not mingled with mental effort;morality is that which is not dependent on the world of desire [not depending on the the qualities, viz. the objects of desire (kāmaguṇa) ], not remaining in the world of forms [tasting the pleasure of meditation (dhyānāsvāda) ], not staying in the formless world [not being born there though having attained the formless states of meditation (ārūpyasamāpatti) ];morality is that which is to give up the impurities of passion, which is avoiding malice, harshness, aversion and repugnance, and which is the absence of delusions, darkness and ignorance;morality is that which is neither [belief in] permanence, nor nihilism, it is not in disaccord with the principle of dependent origination;morality is that which is without the principle of an ego, without things related to the ego, not abiding by the view that there is a permanent substance;morality is that which is no attachment to names [that is, informative concepts (prajñāpti) like Devadatta or Yajñadatta] and signs [like “Devadatta has qualities (guṇavān)”], not abiding by distinguishing marks of form [like “form gives resistance (sapratigha)”] , no mingling with names and forms [that is, the parts of personality (skandha) ];morality is that which is absence of causal bad dispositions, non-arising of doctrinal view-points, (p. 37) not abiding by hindrances like regret;morality is that which does not abide by the root of bad which is covetousness, does not abide by the root of bad which is aversion, does not abide by the root of bad which is delusion;morality is that which is indefatigable, without desires and thus having the essential character of tranquility;morality is that which is the non-interruption of the Buddhas’ lineage because of [attaining] the transcendent body, non-interruption of the lineage of religious teaching because of [attaining] non-separation from total reality, non-interruption of the lineage of the religious community because the unconditioned is revealed.
Morality, reverend Śāradvatīputra, should be seen as imperishable because of the imperishability of its continuity.
Why? The morality of ordinary people perishes because of the places they are born;the morality of those possessing the five outer supernormal powers [like the seers (ṛṣi) ] perishes when they are deprived of their supernormal powers;the morality of men perishes when the ten ways of good action perish;the morality of the sons of gods in the world of desire perishes when their merit perishes;the morality of the sons of gods in the world of form perishes when their immeasurable states and meditations perish;the morality of the sons of gods in the formless world perishes when their meditation-produced births perish;the morality of disciples – those still to be trained and those needing no more training – perishes in the end by extinction;the morality of isolated buddhas perishes because of their lack of great compassion.But the morality of the bodhisattvas, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is imperishable.Why? Because all types of morality originate from that morality [which here is to be taken in the same meaning as the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), the essence (svabhāva) of that morality].Just as, reverend Śāradvatīputra, when the seed is imperishable, the gain is also imperishable, thus, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the morality of the Tathāgatas should be known as imperishable since its seed, the thought of awakening, is imperishable.And that is why these good men are called “those whose morality is imperishable”.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable morality.
7th Imperishable: Tolerance.
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra addressed himself to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati: – Well spoken by you, son of good family, was this imperishability of the bodhisattvas’ morality. May you be inspired, son of good family, on the subject of the imperishability of the bodhisattvas’ tolerance, as to how the tolerance of the bodhisattvas becomes imperishable.
[1. Tolerance enduring pain (duḥkhādhivāsakṣānti):] Akṣayamati said: – Reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ tolerance is to be seen through thirty-two forms. Which thirty-two?
[a. Being without the causes which are contary to tolerance (kṣāntivipakṣahetu):]1) Tolerance should be seen in the giving up of bad dispositions [like aversion (pratigha), etc., causes of intolerance (akṣāntihetu) ];2) tolerance is to be seen in the absence of inflicting injury;3) tolerance is to be seen in the absence of anguish;4) tolerance is to be seen in the absence of malice;5) tolerance is to be seen in the absence of enmity;6) tolerance is to be seen in the absence of rage;7) tolerance is to be seen in the absence of quarreling;8) tolerance is to be seen in the absence of dispute.[b. Adopting tolerance as the antidote (kṣāntipratipakṣasamādāna):] 9) Tolerance is to be seen in not being injured by the outside world [not falling under the sway of the causes (pratyaya) of anger (krodha) etc. in the outside world];10) tolerance is to be seen in guarding oneself and others [so that no-one comes under the sway of intolerance];11) tolerance is to be seen as in accordance with the thought of awakening [tolerating all beings with a friendliness as for one’s only son (ekaputramaitrī) ];12) tolerance is to be seen in thorough spiritual penetration [which is cultivation of friendliness (maitrībhāvanā), the contrary to aversion (dveṣapratipakṣa) ];13) tolerance is to be seen in disgust for worldly things and absence of cupidity [since then there is no intolerance for the disagreeable];14) tolerance is to be seen in confidence in the fact that actions mature [knowing that to suffer when harmed by another is to experience the fruit of bad actions done by oneself].[c. Purity of the actions of tolerance (kṣāntikarmaviśuddhi):] 15) Tolerance is to be seen in the ornamenting of the body [as the person having tolerance is without the ugly features of contracted eyebrows (bhṛkuṭi), changed colour of the face (mukhavarṇa) or bloodshot eyes (lohitākṣa), with tranquil senses (śāntendriya) and good health (ojas) ];16) tolerance is to be seen in purity of speech and thought;17) tolerance is to be seen in firm intention;18) tolerance is to be seen in [understanding that] syllables [of abusive speech] are void [syllables and words, being empty and selfless, cannot frighten, they should be known as void, thus one should understand their deeper meaning];19) tolerance is to be seen in the absence of thought-constructions [concerning who is harming, what harm is done, who is harmed];20) tolerance is to be seen in introspection into one’s own thoughts;21) tolerance is to be seen in protecting the thoughts of others.[d. Attaining the fruit of tolerance (kṣāntiphalasamādāna):]22) Tolerance is to be seen in going the way to the world of Brahmā [attaining the four immeasurable qualities (caturapramāṇa) ];23) tolerance is to be seen in experiencing the good qualities of gods and men;24) tolerance is to be seen in perfecting the characteristics of a great man and the marks of beauty;25) tolerance is to be seen in attaining speech with a voice like that of Brahmā;26) tolerance is to be seen in having done away with all sins;27) tolerance is to be seen in having done away with malice, harshness and aversion;28) tolerance is to be seen in rejecting anger;29) tolerance is to be seen in rejecting all roots of bad;30) tolerance is to be seen in the crushing of one’s enemies;31) tolerance is to be seen in aloofness from the harm done by others;32) tolerance is to be seen as [the cause (hetu) of] attaining all the qualities of a Buddha [as the perfection of tolerance (kṣāntipāramitā) ].The bodhisattvas’ tolerance, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is to be seen through these thirty-two forms.
[2. Tolerance enduring harm [from others] (apakāramarṣaṇakṣānti):]What then is purified tolerance?
One does not respond to insults with more insults through understanding that speech is [unreal] like an echo;one does not respond to beatings with more beatings through understanding that the body is [unreal] like a reflection;one does not respond to abuse with more abuse through understanding that thoughts are [unreal] like an illusion;one does not respond to anger with more anger through having the determination to be peaceful;one does not feel aversion at not being praised through the accomplishment of one’s own qualities;one is not flattered by praise through the absence of conceit;one feels no joy at gain through being well trained;one feels no aversion to loss through utter peace;one does not get perplexed by fame through discerning it with wisdom;one feels no despondency at the absence of fame because of broadmindedness;one is not depressed by blame because one is well established;one is not exalted by praise since one is not unstable;one is not fatigued by suffering through regard for living beings;one does not get excited by pleasure because of the impermanence of conditioned pleasure;one does not get sullied by the ways of the world since one is dependent on nothing;one tolerates violence against oneself through using no violence against others;one accepts the cutting off of limbs and extremities through fulfilling the attainment of the limbs of awakening;one tolerates the destruction of one’s own body through desiring the body of a Buddha;one tolerates every misdeed through developing the power of doing good actions;one endures [bodily] pain and [mental] suffering through having the courage to defeat all other ascetics;one undertakes every kind of asceticism through overpowering the king of the gods, the lord of the universe and the protectors of the world.
[3. Tolerance applied to reflection on the moments of existence (dharmanidhyānādhimokṣakṣānti):]Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, this tolerance is something absolutely invulnerable.Why? Because it is beyond apprehension.
Tolerance thinking “He abuses me,” is tolerance apprehending duality, it is not absolute tolerance;tolerance thinking “Who [in the sense of an permanent ego] abuses here?” is tolerance calculating and constructing moments of existence [as reflecting “The element of earth (pṛthivīdhātu) belonging to that person abuses my element of earth”], it is not absolute tolerance;tolerance thinking “How can it be that [his] sight abuses my sight?”, and similarly, tolerance thinking “How can it be concerning my hearing, smelling, tasting and body, and how can it be that [his] mind abuses my mind?”, is tolerance concerning the fields of sense-perception, it is not absolute tolerance;tolerance thinking “No one abuses here,” is tolerance with thought-constructions about egolessness, it is not absolute tolerance;tolerance thinking “These things come from sounds of syllables,” is tolerance as of an echo, it is not absolute tolerance;tolerance thinking “He is impermanent, I am also impermanent,” is tolerance engaged in impermanence, it is not absolute tolerance;tolerance thinking “He is perverted, I am not perverted,” is tolerance concerned with high and low, it is not absolute tolerance;tolerance thinking “I am right, he is wrong,” is tolerance concerned with right and wrong, it is not absolute tolerance;tolerance thinking “I am established on good ways, he is established on bad ways,” is tolerance concerned with good ways and bad ways, it is not absolute tolerance;tolerance thinking “I tolerate impermanence, but I do not tolerate permanence,” is tolerance rejecting [the opposite] by menas of an antidote, it is not absolute tolerance;tolerance thinking “I tolerate suffering, but I do not tolerate pleasure, I tolerate egolessness, but I do not tolerate ego-ness; I tolerate the ugly, but I do not tolerate the beautiful,” is tolerance rejecting [the opposite] by means of an antidote, it is not absolute tolerance;tolerance thinking “I tolerate emptiness, but I do not tolerate doctrinal viewpoints, I tolerate absence of distinguishing marks, but I do not tolerate the thought-constructions consisting in distinguishing marks, I tolerate the absence of longing, but I do not tolerate longing, I tolerate the absence of conditionality, but I do not tolerate conditionality, I tolerate the the cessation of all vices, but I do not tolerate the vices, I tolerate the good, but I do not tolerate the bad, I tolerate the transcendent, but I do not tolerate the worldly, I tolerate the unblamable, but I do not tolerate the blamable, I tolerate the unsullied, but I do not tolerate the sullied, I tolerate the purified, but I do not tolerate the impure, I tolerate extinction, but I do not tolerate existence,” is tolerance rejecting [the opposite] by means of an antidote, it is not absolute tolerance.
What then is absolute tolerance?
It is understanding emptiness, but not suppressing doctrinal views nor imputing concepts of emptiness; tolerance that “Doctrinal views are empty,” is absolute tolerance.Understanding the absence of distinguishing marks, but not suppressing the form of distinguishing marks nor imputing concepts of no distinguishing marks; tolerance that “The form of distinguishing marks is empty,” is absolute tolerance.Understanding the absence of longing, but not suppressing longing (p. 41) nor imputing concepts of no longing; tolerance that “Longing is empty,” is absolute tolerance.Understanding the absence of conditionality, but not suppressing conditionality nor imputing concepts of no conditionality; tolerance that “The conditioned is empty,” is absolute tolerance.Understanding the cessation of vices, but not suppressing vices nor imputing concepts of vices’ cessation; tolerance that “Vices are empty,” is absolute tolerance.Understanding the good, but not suppressing the bad nor imputing concepts of good; tolerance that “The bad is empty,” is absolute tolerance.Understanding the transcendent, but not suppressing the worldly nor imputing concepts of transcendence; tolerance that “The worldly is empty,” is absolute tolerance.Understanding the unblamable, but not suppressing the blamable nor imputing concepts of being unblamable; tolerance that “The blamable is empty,” is absolute tolerance.Understanding the unsullied, but not suppressing the sullied nor imputing concepts of being unsullied; tolerance that “The sullied is empty,” is absolute tolerance.Understanding the pure, but not suppressing the impure nor imputing concepts of purity; tolerance that “The impure is empty,” is absolute tolerance.Understanding extinction, but not suppressing existence nor imputing concepts of extinction; tolerance that “Existence is empty,” is absolute tolerance.
What is unoriginated does not originate, is inexistent; in that, being inexistent, there is no destruction whatsoever; and since there is no destruction, there is no decay; tolerance of this is absolute tolerance.
In what is not made [by any agent (kāraka), etc.], unconditioned [by causes and conditions (hetupratyaya) ], not imputed [and thus taught], unconstructed [as by the intelligence of logicians (tārkikānāṃ matinā) ], not possible to demonstrate [by logical means (pramāṇa) ], not possible to display [and teach to others], beyond limitations [of the fields of perception (viṣaya) to which one is attached (abhiniviṣṭa) giving them the character of subject and object (grāhyagrāhakalakṣaṇa) ], there is no origination; what is beyond origination does not originate; that which does not originate is absolute tolerance.That kind of tolerance is tolerance of the unoriginated, and tolerance that things are unoriginated is absolute tolerance.The bodhisattva who understands that kind of tolerance is one who has achieved tolerance of what is predicted for him.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable tolerance.
When the bodhisattva Akṣayamati had taught that discourse on religion, the Chapter on the Imperishability of Tolerance, the whole of that assembly applauded the bodhisattva Akṣayamati, and to honour him (p. 42) they showered him with flowers, perfumes, incense, garlands, ointments, aromatic powders, garments, parasols, banners and celestial pennants such as had never been seen or heard of before. They sounded instruments and proclaimed: “Those who do not get frightened [by hearing (śruta) ], alarmed [by pondering on (cintā) ] or scared [by cultivating it (bhāvanā) ] when they hear about this imperishability of tolerance, they have the tolerance of the Tathāgatas.” And they showered him with such an amount of flowers, perfumes, incense, garlands, ointments, aromatic powders, garments, parasols, banners and celestial pennants that it filled up the whole system of threefold thousand great thousand worlds to the top.
Then the Lord addressed himself to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati saying: – Make a vessel, son of good family, for these flowers, perfumes, incense, garlands, ointments, aromatic powders, garments, parasols, banners and celestial pennants!
Akṣayamati said: – The vessels of bodhisattvas, Lord, are their own bodies by virtue of their assumption of the power of magical transformation – thus I will make one.
Then the bodhisattva Akṣayamati entered the bodhisattva-concentration named “Absorption of all forms in the body“. As soon he had done so, those flowers, perfumes, incense, garlands, ointments, aromatic powders, garments, parasols, banners and celestial pennants were absorbed into his navel, but his body did not appear to diminish or increase in size.
Then a bodhisattva called Mahāvyūha sitting there, having come to that same assembly, addressed himself to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati saying: – What is the name of that concentration, son of good family, in which you stay when so many flowers, perfumes, incense, garlands, ointments, aromatic powders, garments, parasols, banners and celestial pennants are absorbed into your body – without your body appearing to diminish or increase in size?
Akṣayamati said: – The name of that concentration, son of good familly, is “Absorption of all forms in the body”.
The bodhisattva Mahāvyūha said: – What is the range of this concentration, son of good family?
Akṣayamati said: – Even if all the forms of this system of threefold thousand great thousand worlds, son of good family, were to be absorbed into my body, the condition of my body would undergo no increase or decrease.
There, in that assembly, some bodhisattvas, gods and men thought: “We too wish to see the power of that concentration“.
Then the Lord realized what those bodhisattvas, gods (p. 43) and men were thinking, and addressed himself to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati saying: – You should demonstrate, son of good family, the power of that concentration.
Then the bodhisattva Akṣayamati, by cultivating that concentration, absorbed the whole of that assembly, the bodhisattvas assembled from the ten directions, as well as the Lord attended by his congregation of monks, into his body. And having absorbed them, he showed them such wealth and enjoyment as are found among the bodhisattvas in the multitude of world-spheres in the Buddha-field of the Tathāgata Bhūṣaṇarāja. And everyone in that assembly thought that they had personally entered the body of the bodhisattva Akṣayamati. Then, when the bodhisattva Akṣayamati had displayed this great miracle, he again put the whole of that assembly, all those bodhisattvas coming from the ten directions and the Lord attended by the congregation of monks back in their seats.
Then the bodhisattva Mahāvyūha addressed himself to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati saying: – It is miraculous, son of good family, the power of this concentration.
Akṣayamati said: – Even though the whole system of threefold thousand great thousand worlds, son of good family, were to be absorbed into my body, the condition of my body displays no increase or decrease.
When this discourse on religion, the chapter on the imperishability of tolerance was taught, and when this miracle was displayed, seventy-six million divine and human beings produced the thought of the incomparable absolute awakening, and twenty thousand bodhisattvas attained the tolerance that moments of existence are unborn.
8th Imperishable: Vigour.(p. 45)
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra addressed himself to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati: – Well spoken by you, son of good family, was this imperishability of the bodhisattvas’ tolerance. May you be inspired, son of good family, on the subject of the imperishability of the bodhisattvas’ vigour, as to how the vigour of the bodhisattvas becomes imperishable.
[1. The variety of vigour (vīryaprabheda):] Akṣayamati said: – These eight, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are the bodhisattvas’ assumptions of vigour. Which eight? They are: 1) Imperishable armour; 2) imperishable courage; 3) imperishable attainment; 4) imperishable maturation of beings; 5) imperishable accumulation of merit; 6) imperishable accumulation of knowledge; 7) imperishable accumulation of insight; 8) imperishable accumulation in the attainment of all the Buddha-qualities.
1) What then, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the bodhisattva’s imperishable armour?
Not exhausted by existence, he does not seek awakening by counting aeons, thinking: “For so many aeons I will put on armour, for so many aeons I will not put on armour,” but he puts on an inconceivable armour, thinking: “Even if the period from the beginning of existence1 were like the time of one night and day, and even if I were to produce a single thought of awakening and see a single Tathāgata, worthy of offerings and fully awakened, in a half month of fifteen days of that kind of night and day, in a month of thirty such days, in a year of twelve months, or even in, by calculating the years in this way, a hundred thousand years; and even if I were to know the mental behaviour of one being by producing so many thoughts of awakening and by seeing so many Tathāgatas as the river Gaṅgā has grains of sand, according to that kind of calculation, that computation, then I will know the mental behaviour of all sentient beings, each and every one of them, through producing that many thoughts of awakening and seeing that many Tathāgatas according to that calculation and that computation.” This is the armour without fatigue.
“I will, according to this same calculation, this same computation, serve so many Tathāgatas as the river Gaṅgā has grains of sand to fulfil the perfection of generosity; I will, according to this same calculation, this same computation, serve so many Tathāgatas as the river Gaṅgā has grains of sand to fulfil the perfection of morality; and, in the same way, I will, according to this same calculation, this same computation, serve so many Tathāgatas as the river Gaṅgā has grains of sand to fulfil the perfections of tolerance, vigour, meditation and insight; (p. 46) in the same way, I will, according to this same calculation, this same computation, serve so many Tathāgatas as the river Gaṅgā has grains of sand to fulfil all the moments of existence that are wings of awakening, to fulfill all the characteristics and marks of beauty, to fulfil all the powers, intrepidities and special qualities of a Buddha pertaining to a Tathāgata; I will, according to this same calculation, this same computation, by means of seeing so many Tathāgatas as the river Gaṅgā has grains of sand, by those productions of thoughts of awakening bring about one characteristic of a great man; I will, by this procedure bring about the accomplishment of all the characteristics and marks of beauty.” This armour without fatigue is the bodhisattvas’ imperishable armour.
2) What then is the bodhisattva’s imperishable courage?
[1. How it is (yathā):] Making himself enter the system of threefold thousand great thousand worlds, even when it is filled up with fire,[2. and for what (yadartham):] in the effort to see the Tathāgata, is the bodhisattva’s imperishable courage;the bodhisattva’s courage is the effort to hear religion;the bodhisattva’s courage is the effort to bring beings to maturity;the bodhisattva’s courage is the effort for the sake of all moments of existence that are roots of the good;the bodhisattva’s courage is the effort for the sake of the knowledge that is omniscience.[3. Explanation of the word (nirukti):] The bodhisattva’s courage is called courage since he enters into the world for the benefit of others,[to appease their vices (kleśapraśamanāya), to discipline their abilities (indriya) and for the sake of the complete extinction of all of existence (sarvasaṃsāraparinirvāṇāya), entering the system of threefold thousand great thousand worlds even when it is filled up with fire], it is called courage since he is entering into the world to give peace to others, to discipline others, for the sake of others’ complete extinction;[4. the essence of that vigour (tasya vīrasya svabhāvaḥ), 5. its cause (hetu) and 6. action (karma):] it is called courage since it is entering into the world always intent on the good of living beings [its action (karma) ], being established in great compassion [the cause (hetu) ] stemming from good intentions, never loose, never narrow, firm and never turning back [the essence (svabhāva) ].
[Including both 7. insight and 8. expedient means (prajñopāyaparigṛhīta):] Everywhere when going, putting the foot down, raising the foot, he makes the thought of awakening present, and though he has regard for living beings [which is expedient means (upāya) ] he does not fall to the side of vices [which is insight (prajñā) ]; this is the bodhisattva’s imperishable courage.
3) What then is the bodhisattva’s imperishable attainment?
The transformation of all good thoughts, as they arise, into awakening is the bodhisattva’s imperishable attainment. Why? Because they have been transformed into awakening.
There is, namely, no destruction or interruption whatsoever in between, until he is sitting in the place of awakening, of the roots of good transformed into awakening. Just as, reverend Śāradvatīputra, there is no destruction or interruption in between, until the end of the aeon, of a drop of water fallen into the great ocean, in exactly the same way there is no destruction or interruption whatsoever in between of roots of good transformed into awakening, until he is sitting in the place of awakening.
It is called attainment because it is bringing together in the proper way,(p. 47) and the roots of good he attains setting out on the way he transforms so as to protect all beings, bring all beings to maturity, introduce all beings to the roots of good.[Why does he transform that way?] Those roots of good he transforms to realize the knowledge of omniscience.[What will he do having transformed thus?] Those roots of good he transforms to nourish all beings;those roots of good he transforms to establish all beings in complete extinction, in the knowledge of omniscience.That is the bodhisattva’s imperishable attainment.
4) What then is the bodhisattva’s imperishable maturing of living beings [or, rather, what is the imperishable vigour (vīrya) in maturing living beings]?
The sphere of living beings is immeasurable, but the bodhisattva should relate to it by this way of calculating: “If I in one day could bring to maturity all the beings included in a system of threefold thousand great thousand worlds, and in this way could mature spheres of living beings for innumerable, countless, unthinkable numbers of aeons, could mature innumerable spheres of living beings for such a long time, countless spheres for such a long time, unthinkable numbers for such a long time, even after I had done this, I would not have matured even one hundredth part of all living beings, even one thousandth part, even one hundredthousandth part, even one millionth part, even one ten-millionth part, even one billionth part, even one ten-billionth part, even any number, even any part, even any counting, even any example, even any comparison,” if the bodhisattva, having heard such a statement, does not get frightened, alarmed or scared, he should be known as a bodhisattva who has exexerted himself with vigour. This is the bodhisattva’s imperishable maturing of living beings.
5) What then is the bodhisattva’s imperishable accumulation of merit [or, rather, what is the imperishable vigour (vīrya) in accumulating merit]?
The bodhisattva’s merit is immeasurable, and the bodhisattva should apply this sort of calculation to it: “So much as is the merit of all beings, of all disciples, both those to be trained and those having completed their training, and isolated buddhas of the past, present and future, by all this merit multiplied by a hundred one pore of the Tathāgata’s body is accomplished; in the same way, so much as is the mass of merit pertaining to all the pores multiplied by a hundred, by that one mass of attained unhindered merit one mark of beauty on the Tathāgata’s body is accomplished; in the same way all the marks of beauty are accomplished one by one; in the same way, so much as is the mass of merit pertaining to all the marks of beauty multiplied by a thousand, by that one mass of attained unhindered merit one characteristic of a great man is accomplished; in the same way the thirty-two characteristics of a great man are accomplished one by one on the body; and so much as is the mass of merit pertaining to the mark on the forehead, by that the attained mass of merit multiplied by a hundred thousand the characteristic of a great man which is the invisible crown of the head is accomplished on the body of the Tathāgata; (p. 47) and that mass of merit pertaining to the crown, by that mass of attained merit multiplied by a thousand billions or even more the Tathāgata’s conch of religion is accomplished,and by means of that conch of religion the Tathāgata makes a sound in worlds without end and without limit as he wishes, and pleases the senses of all beings according to their faith in and intentions concerned with religion and discipline,” if, having heard this way into the bodhisattva’s accumulation of merit, he does not get frightened, alarmed or scared, then this is the bodhisattva’s imperishable accumulation of merit.
6) What then is the bodhisattva’s imperishable accumulation of knowledge [or, rather, what is the imperishable vigour (vīrya) in accumulating knowledge]?
The bodhisattva’s accumulation of knowledge is immeasurable, and the bodhisattva should apply this sort of calculation to it: “If all beings in the system of threefold thousand great thousand worlds all had the knowledge of a faith-follower, their knowledge would not amount even to one hundreth part of that of one having the knowledge of a follower of the teaching, it would not amount to one thousandth part, hundred thousandth part, ten millionth part, billionth, ten billionth, thousand billionth part, any number, any part, any example, even any comparison.Thus also with those having knowledge in accordance with religion compared with one with the knowledge of the eighth stage,those with the knowledge of the eighth stage compared with one with the knowledge of one who has entered the stream,those with the knowledge of one who has entered the stream compared with one with the knowledge of the one returning only once,those with the knowledge of one returning only once compared with one with the knowledge of one never returning,those with the knowledge of one never returning compared with one with the knowledge of an arhat,those with the knowledge of an arhat compared with one with the knowledge of an isolated buddha,[the knowledge of] those with the knowledge of an isolated buddha does not amount to one hundredth part of the [knowledge] of one with the knowledge of a bodhisattva, perfected through a hundred aeons,it would not amount to even any example, any comparison; those with the knowledge of a bodhisattva perfected through a hundred aeons compared with one with the knowledge of of a bodhisattva who has attained tolerance,those with the knowledge of a bodhisattva who has attained tolerance compared with one with the knowledge of a bodhisattva who never turns back,[the knowledge of] those with the knowledge of a bodhisattva who never turns back does not amount to a hundredth part of [the knowledge of] a bodhisattva hindered by only one birth,it would not amount to any example, any comparison; even if the beings in this system of threefold thousand great thousand worlds had the knowledge of a bodhisattva hindered by only one birth, it would not amount to even one hundredth part of the knowledge of a bodhisattva sitting in the place of awakening,it would not amount even to any example, any comparison; even if the beings in the endless systems of threefold thousand great thousand worlds (p. 49) had the knowledge of a bodhisattva sitting in the place of awakening, it would not amount even to one hundredth part of the Tathāgata’s power of knowledge of the possible and impossible,it would not amount even to any example, any comparison,” such is the bodhisattva’s gradual accomplishment of all the powers, intrepidities and eighteen special qualities of a Buddha, and when the bodhisattva, having heard this way into the accumulation of merit, does not get frightened, alarmed or scared, then this is the bodhisattva’s imperishable accumulation of knowledge.
7) What then is the bodhisattva’s imperishable accumulation of insight [or, rather, what is the imperishable vigour (vīrya) in accumulating insight]?
The imperishable accumulation of insight is the knowledge of penetrating the mental behaviour of all beings: “Even if the thoughts of all living beings, past, present and future, were found in one mental effort of one living being, and, in this way, even if all living beings were filled with an immense number of such thoughts, even if the cupidity, aversion and bewilderment of all living beings, past, present and future, were all found in one thought of one living being, by this order of things, if all living beings were filled with an immense number of such thoughts, in relation to this the bodhisattva develops such an accumulation of insight, by means of which accumulation, being accumulated, all productions of thought included in the minds of those living beings would be known, each one arisen in connection with its proper object, then broken up and melted away. And by that insight there would be no absence of knowledge whatsoever concerning the manifestations of thoughts and vices in the three times of those living beings.”.
Reverend Śāradvatīputra, just as there is nothing which is not pervaded by space, just so there is no manifestation of thought or vice of those living beings which is not illumined and thoroughly known by the insight of that bodhisattva.
This is the bodhisattva’s imperishable accumulation of insight.
8) What then is the imperishable accumulation of the attainment of all Buddha-qualities [or, rather, what is the imperishable accumulation of vigour (vīrya) in attaining all the Buddha-qualities]?
The imperishable accumulation of attaining all Buddha-qualities is piling up the accumulation of all roots of good, piling up the accumulation of all the perfections, piling up the accumulation of all moments of existence conducive to awakening. Piling up practice with the thought of awakening as the object, from the first production of the thought of awakening to sitting in the place of awakening, the accumulation of good thoughts by means of which all qualities of a Buddha are attained, this is the bodhisattva’s imperishable accumulation of attaining all Buddha-qualities.
These eight, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are the bodhisattvas’ eight assumptions of vigour.
[2. Teaching all the gates of vigour (vīryamukha):] Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, (p. 50) the imperishable vigour of bodhisattvas is the basis of the body’s good actions, the basis of speech’s good actions, the basis of mind’s good actions. Why? Because all that is vigour is associated with body, speech and mind.
[3. All vigour is subsumed under vigour in thought (cittavīrya) including insight and expedient means (prajñopāyaparigṛhīta):] But vigour in thought is according to tradition superior to vigour in body and speech.
What then is vigour of thought?
Activity of thought [which is expedient means (upāya), under which embarking upon the different practices of the bodhisattva is subsumed] and stillness of thought [which is insight (prajñā), completing those practices].
[The divisions (prabheda):] What then is activity of thought? It is undertaking the thought of awakening [from the first time on, which is expedient means (upāya) ]. What then is stillness of thought? It is the peacefulness of the thought of awakening [without any undertaking (anārambha) or effort (anābhoga), which is insight (prajñā) ].
What then is activity? Great compassion for living beings. What then is stillness? Tolerance of ego-lessness.
What then is activity? Bringing living beings together [with the four means (or, “substances”) for bringing them together (saṃgrahavastu) ]. What then is stillness? Not grasping any moment of existence [in not grasping for substance (vastu) in any moment of existence through insight (prajñā) ].
What then is activity? Never getting tired of existence. What then is stillness? Not apprehending the threefold world.
What then is activity? Giving away all belongings. What then is stillness? No conceit because of generosity.
What then is activity? Taking training upon oneself. What then is stillness? No conceit because of training.
What then is activity? Tolerance and endurance. What then is stillness? Invulnerability in thought.
What then is activity? Undertaking all roots of good. What then is stillness? Aloofness of thought [giving up the bad and construing no undertakings of good].
What then is activity? Attainment of meditation. What then is stillness? Introspection into thought [beyond discursive thinking (prapañcâtīta) ].
What then is activity? Never getting tired of learning. What then is stillness? Thorough mental effort.
What then is activity? Teaching religion according to tradition. What then is stillness? The inexpressible state of things.
What then is activity? Seeking the accumulation of knowledge. What then is stillness? Complete excision of discursive thought.
What then is activity? Accumulating the pure ways of behaviour. What then is stillness? Equanimity by right knowledge [no thought-constructions (akalpanā) concerning friendliness (maitrī) and so on towards living beings].
What then is activity? Fulfilling the five supernormal powers. What then is stillness? Cultivating absence of impurity [the sixth supernormal power].
What then is activity? Practice of recollection. What then is stillness? No mental effort in recollection [not apprehending (upalabh-) distinct characteristics (lakṣaṇa) of the body, etc.].
What then is activity? Right exertion and practice. What then is stillness? Giving up good and bad thoughts.
What then is activity? Realizing the bases of magical power. What then is stillness? Effort in effortless action.
What then is activity? Expertness with the senses. What then is stillness? Seeing the moments of existence beyond the senses [the pure sphere of all moments of existence (viśuddhadharmadhātu) ].
(p. 51) What then is activity? Attainment of power. What then is stillness? Uncrushable knowledge.
What then is activity? Attainment of the limbs of awakening. What then is stillness? Knowledge of skill in knowing the way to discern moments of existence.
What then is activity? Seeking the accumulations on the way. What then is stillness? Not going anywhere.
What then is activity? Seeking peaceful meditation. What then is stillness? Thoughts appeased with peaceful meditation.
What then is activity? The practice of expanded vision. What then is stillness? Knowledge of the state of things.
What then is activity? Understanding causes [that is, the causes of impurity (saṃkleśahetu) and ignorance (avidyā), etc., and the causes of purity (vyavadānahetu), cessation of ignorance (avidyānirodha), etc.] What then is stillness? Knowledge of causes [not apprehending (anupalabh-) them].
What then is activity? Listening to the words of others. What then is stillness? Realizing the moments of existence.
What then is activity? Embellishing the body. What then is stillness? The real nature of the body.
What then is activity? Embellishing speech. What then is stillness? Silence of the saints [giving up the discursiveness (prapañca) of speech and staying concentrated inside thought].
What then is activity? Confidence in the three gates of freedom. What then is stillness? No action.
What then is activity? Avoiding the four Evil Ones. What then is stillness? Getting rid of all habits of vice, being connections to new births.
[Then, to summarize:] What then is activity? Seeing through expedient means [producing the thought of awakening (bodhicittotpāda), maturing living beings (sattvaparipāka) and so on]. What then is stillness? Seeing with insight [not apprehending (upalabh-) the thought of awakening, living beings, etc.].
What then is activity? Seeing through undertaking [the practices of a bodhisattva (bodhisattvacaryā) ]. What then is stillness? Perseverance [completing this practice].
What then is activity? Seeing the conventions. What then is stillness? Seeing the highest truth [the ineffable (anabhilāpya) true state of things (dharmatā) beyond words and conventions (nāmasaṃketātīta) ].
This is called vigour in thought. And the one who is established in all activity to fulfil the imperishability of vigour in thought and is far from distinguishing marks, he is established in action through knowledge even though he is engaged in every action of distinguishing marks, he will make every action into action through knowledge.
What then is the bodhisattva’s action through knowledge?
It is when he does not reject the conditioned – for the sake of the roots of good and for the sake of great compassion for living beings – but he does not fall into the unconditioned, so that he will attain the knowledge of a Buddha.
This is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable perfection of vigour.
When this imperishable perfection of vigour was taught, seventy-six hundred billion divine and human creatures produced the thought of awakening, and thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas attained the tolerance that moments of existence are unborn.
9th Imperishable: Meditation.(p. 54)
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra addressed himself to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati: – Well spoken by you, son of good family, was this imperishability of the bodhisattvas’ vigour. May you be inspired, son of good family, on the subject of the imperishability of the bodhisattvas’ meditation, as to how the meditation of the bodhisattvas becomes imperishable.
Akṣayamati said: [1. The state of pure excellence of the forms of meditation (dhyānâkāraviśuddhaviśeṣasthiti):] The bodhisattvas’ imperishability of the perfection of meditation has sixteen forms, reverend Śāradvatīputra, but it is not found among disciples and isolated buddhas.
What then are the sixteen forms?1) [It is hard to practise (duṣkaraviśeṣa):] The meditation of the bodhisattvas is not attached to anything [to reflecting (vitarka) and pondering (vicāra) related to the parts of the four states of meditation (dhyāna) and the four states of concentration (samāpatti), etc.], since it is to fulfil the meditation of the Tathāgatas;2) the meditation of the bodhisattvas is not tasted since there is no attachment to one’s own pleasure;3) the meditation of the bodhisattvas has great compassion as its object [on entering the first state of meditation (prathamadhyāna) ] since it practised to take away the vices of all living beings;4) the meditation of the bodhisattvas is returning from concentration [on higher stages] since it has the world of desire as its object;5) [pure by power of supernormal knowledge and great magic (abhijñāvikurvāṇavaśitāviśuddha):] the meditation of the bodhisattvas has completed the preparations for supernormal knowledge since it knows the mental behaviour of all beings;6) [the pure excellence of power to attain power of thought (cittavaśitāprāptivaśitāviśuddhaviśeṣa):] the meditation of the bodhisattvas is fitness of thought since it is knowledge of the power of thought;7) [the excellence of power of how to enter, stay in and emerge from (praveśasthitivyutthānaviśeṣa):] the meditation of the bodhisattvas is knowledge of all meditations, liberations, concentrations, attaining the states of meditation and emerging from them, since it conquers both the world of forms and the world without forms;8) [the excellence of power distinguished in being supramundane (lokottaraviśiṣṭavaśitāviśeṣa):] the meditation of the bodhisattvas is peaceful, absolutely peaceful, since it conquers the states of meditation of the disciples and the isolated buddhas;9) [the excellence of power not to lose meditation (acyutivaśitāviśeṣa) though getting out of meditation:] the meditation of the bodhisattvas is undisturbed since its certitude is infinite;10) [the excellence of power of no (hindrances concerning) objects to be known and vices (jñeyaniṣkleśavaśitāviśeṣa):] the meditation of the bodhisattvas is contrary to wrong practice since it obliterates all habits of vice which are connections to new births;11) [the pure excellence of views grasping neither for a living being nor for moments of existence (sattvadharmagrāhâpagatadṛṣṭiviśuddhaviśeṣa):] the meditation of the bodhisattvas is penetration into insight since it is transcending all worlds [which are attachment resulting from grasping for a living being or moments of existence (sattvadharmagrāhâbhiniveśa) ];12) [the pure excellence of doing good (anugrahaviśuddhaviśeṣa) with help to living beings in every way (sarvatra sattvânugraha):] the meditation of the bodhisattvas is (p. 55) preceded by intentions regarding all living beings since it is saving all living beings [from the suffering of lower existence and existence generally (durgatibhāvaduḥkha) ];13) [the pure excellence of power not to interrupt the tradition of the three jewels (triratnavaṃśânupacchedavaśitāviśuddhaviśeṣa):] the meditation of the bodhisattvas is the unbrokenness of the tradition of the three jewels since it is the fulfilment of the imperishability of the Tathāgata’s meditation;14) [the pure excellence of not losing it (acyutiviśuddhaviśeṣa):] the meditation of the bodhisattvas does not perish since they are always concentrated [in every situation, going, sitting, etc.];15) [the state of excellence of knowledge (jñānaviśeṣasthiti):] the meditation of the bodhisattvas is knowledge which is mastery of all moments of existence since it is the fulfilment of all the qualities of the Buddha;16) [with greatness of completion (niṣṭhāgamanamahātmyasaṃpanna):] the meditation of the bodhisattvas pervades all space because of the greatness of its knowledge.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the bodhisattvas’ perfection of meditation in sixteen forms, which does not belong to the disciples and isolated buddhas.
[2. The pure fruit resulting from the tranquility of meditation (dhyānapraśrabdhiviśuddhaphala):] What then has meditation as its preparation? Fulfilment of supernormal knowledge and wisdom.What then is supernormal knowledge, what is wisdom?
When he sees the appearance of all forms [with divine sight (divyacakṣur) ], it is called supernormal knowledge; when he knows the essence of all forms to be imperishable, but does not realize this imperishable essence [viz. extinction (nirvāṇa), as the disciples do], it is called wisdom.
When he hears all words [with divine hearing (divyaśrotra) ], it is called supernormal knowledge; the knowledge that cannot be expressed by any words from endless past into the endless future [that is, knowledge without object (anālambana) ], is called wisdom.
When he knows the mental behaviour of all living beings, it is called supernormal knowledge; when he does not realize the cessation of thought when experiencing the cessation of thought, it is called wisdom.
Recollection concerning all past and future is called supernormal knowledge; knowledge not attached to any of the three times [knowing their sameness] is called wisdom.
Going to all Buddha-fields is called supernormal knowledge; when he knows the Buddha-fields to be like empty space, it is called wisdom.
Seeking the unadulterated moments of existence is called supernormal knowledge; knowledge of seeing all moments of existence as the same is called wisdom.
That which has the essential characteristic of not being adulterated in any world is called supernormal knowledge; knowledge of that which is not mingled with any world is called wisdom.
That which triumphs over the king of gods, the lord of the world and the world-protectors [by the power of the end of the sullied states (āsravakṣayaprabhāvena) ] is called supernormal knowledge; knowledge higher than that of disciples and isolated buddhas is called wisdom.
These two, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are said to have the bodhisattvas’ meditation as preparation.
[3. Since it is the antidote of an immeasurable contrary, it is an immeasurable antidote (apramāṇaḥ pratipakṣo ’pramāṇasya vipakṣasya pratipakṣabhūtatvāt):]Further, as many as are the vices and unconcentrated thoughts of all living beings, so great is the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of meditation [that is, the cause of meditation (dhyānahetu) ] and his knowledge of arresting thoughts [the fruit (phala) ];as many as are the vices and unconcentrated thoughts of all living beings, so great is the bodhisattvas’ gathering of the accumulation of meditation.
[4. By the etymology (nirukti) is shown the purity of being established in the undifferentiatedness of objects (ālambanâprabhinnatva):] He is established in that sameness, and thus he is called concentrated.(p. 56) He is established in the sameness of all living beings, in the sameness of thoughts, in the sameness of intention, in the sameness of determination, in the sameness of action, in the sameness of generosity, morality, tolerance, vigour, meditation and insight, in the sameness of all the teachings of the Buddhas, and thus he is called concentrated.
What concentration is the same as, awakening is also the same as that [both being empty];what awakening is the same as, all beings are also the same as that;what all beings are the same as, all moments of existence are also the same as that.He has entered this sameness, thus he is called concentrated.
What emptiness is the same as, absence of distinguishing marks is also the same as that; what absence of distinguishing marks is the same as, all beings are also the same as that; what all beings are the same as, all moments of existence are also the same as that. He has entered this sameness, thus he is called concentrated.
What absence of distinguishing marks is the same as, no longing is also the same as that; what no longing is the same as, all beings are also the same as that; what all beings are the same as, all moments of existence are also the same as that. He has entered this sameness, thus he is called concentrated.
What no longing is the same as, the unconditioned is also the same as that; what the unconditioned is the same as, all beings are also the same as that; what all beings are the same as, all moments of existence are also the same as that. He has entered this sameness, thus he is called concentrated.
What the unconditioned is the same as, the unoriginated is also the same as that; what the unoriginated is the same as, all beings are also the same as that; what all beings are the same as, all moments of existence are also the same as that. He has entered this sameness, thus he is called concentrated.
What the unoriginated is the same as, the unproduced is also the same as that; what the unproduced is the same as, all beings are also the same as that; what all beings are the same as, all moments of existence are also the same as that. He has entered this sameness, thus he is called concentrated.
What the unproduced is the same as, the inexistent is also the same as that; what the inexistent is the same as, all beings are also the same as that; what all beings are the same as, all moments of existence are also the same as that. He has entered this sameness, thus he is called concentrated.
What the inexistent is the same as, purity is also the same as that; what purity is the same as, all beings are also the same as that; what all beings are the same as, all moments of existence are also the same as that. He has entered this sameness, thus he is called concentrated.
(p. 57) [For a long time cultivating it] he has entered the sameness of all beings’ thoughts which are the same as one’s own thoughts [in being essentially and originally pure], thus he is called concentrated.
[5. Giving up mental effort concerned with being an antidote (pratipakṣamanasikāraprahāṇa), meditation is]sameness in any benefit and injury,[that is,] to have thoughts the same as earth,thoughts the same as water,thoughts the same as fire,thoughts the same as wind,thoughts the same as space, [to illustrate it with examples];not to behave so as to be conceited [when succeeding] or depressed [when failing in bodhisattva-meditation],being undisturbed;to be concentrated in all bodily movement,not artificial in bodily movement [being concentrated in construing each movement (pratyekaṃ parikalpayitvā samāhitaḥ) ],[but] naturally in a state of concentration,(prakṛtisamāpannatā),not agitated or wavering,moderation in speech,and no bad speech;knowing the meaning [of the teachings that things are empty, selfless, etc.] and knowing the [words, letters, etc., of the] teachings [both teaching the knowledge of the things on which to meditate (bhāvayitavyajñāna) ];knowing the time [that is, the seasons when to meditate], knowing [which] time [of the day to meditate], knowing the inopportune [and thus the time to get up, eat, walk about, etc., three items teaching the knowledge of the time of meditation (bhāvanākālajñāna) ];not to be mingled with the world though connected with all worlds,[combining in the bodhisattvas’ meditation (dhyāna) insight and expedient means yoked in a team (prajñopāyayuganaddhaparigṛhīta), in the way that he is] beyond the eight ways of the world,not mingled with any of the vices,aloofness of behaviour even in crowds;the bodhisattva stays within these moments of existence and does not give up the state of being concentrated [by insight (prajñā) ], but even so he manifests himself in every worldly matter [through expedient means (upāya) ].
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattva’s perfection of meditation brought about through insight and expedient means.
What then is the bodhisattva’s expedient means, what is his insight?
[6. Staying with the purified antidote (viśuddhapratipakṣasthiti), by which is explained fully how insight and expedient means yoked in a team are combined (prajñopāyayuganaddhaparigṛhīta) in the bodhisattva’s meditation (dhyāna):]
When the bodhisattva in a state of concentration with regard for living beings produces thoughts with great compassion as the object, it is the bodhisattva’s expedient means; when he practises meditation which is peace [and thus beyond thought-constructions and action], it is his insight.
When the bodhisattva in a state of concentration has confidence that he will attain the knowledge of a Buddha, it is his expedient means; when he practises meditation not dependent on any moment of existence whatsoever, it is his insight.
When the bodhisattva in a state of concentration has grasping true religion in view, it is his expedient means; when he practises meditation inseparable from absolute reality, it is his insight.
When the bodhisattva during his states of concentration realizes the embellishment of a Buddha’s body [with the characteristics of a great man and the marks of beauty (lakṣaṇānuvyañjana) ], it is his expedient means; when he practises meditation inseparable from the body of absolute reality, it is his insight.
When the bodhisattva in a state of concentration thinks about the Buddha’s speech being like the voice of Brahmā, it is his expedient means; when he meditates on the ineffability of the true nature of things, it is his insight.
When the bodhisattva in a state of concentration masters thought in a way that it becomes [invulnerable (avraṇita) to the vices and able to crush the vices] like diamond, it is his expedient means; when he meditates on the originally undistracted [the essence of thought beyond subject and object], it is his insight.
When the bodhisattva in a state of concentration masters maturing living beings through his earlier vows [from the time when he first produced the thought of awakening (prathamacittotpāda) ], it is his expedient means; when he meditates on the selflessness of all beings, it is his insight.
When he in a state of concentration meditates reaching for all roots of the good, it is his expedient means; when he meditates on the location of the roots of good as similar to empty space [seeing that meditation and roots of good are without essence (niḥsvabhāva) ], it is his insight.
When he in a state of concentration realizes the purity of his Buddha-field, it is his expedient means; when he meditates on the Buddha-field’s likeness to empty space, it is his insight.
(p. 58)When he in a state of concentration realizes as an object the splendour of the embellishment of the place of awakening, it is his expedient means; when he meditates to calm all vices, it is his insight.
When he in a state of concentration wishes to turn the wheel of religion, it is his expedient means; when he meditates on neither turning nor not turning, it is his insight.
When the bodhisattva in a state of concentration realizes the absence of distraction in the accumulation of the members of awakening, it is his expedient means;when he practises meditation in accordance with all that is determined for the bodhisattva to get rid of all the burning pains of vices and impurities [that torment the train of thoughts (cittasaṃtāna) ] known by the Tathāgatas, mental or not mental, beyond perception or through perception, it is his insight.
The bodhisattva provided with such qualities is imperishable through the perfection of meditation, and none of the Evil Ones are able to get at him; he is near to the vessel filled with all the qualities of the Buddha, and he attains the wisdom of omniscience.
When this imperishability of peaceful meditation was taught, the concentration named “Light of the sun” was attained by thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas.
Why is that concentration called “Light of the sun“?
Just as all the lights of the moon and the stars, the light of oil-lamps, and the light of grass on fire is eclipsed when the sun rises, in the same way, when the bodhisattva has attained the concentration “Light of the sun”, all inferior and limited insight is eclipsed by the light of his insight, the insight of those still to be trained and the trained, the insight of the isolated buddhas and the insight of all ordinary beings besides is eclipsed by the light of his insight; and that is why it is called “Light of the sun“.
The bodhisattva abiding in the perfection of meditation attains different forms of concentration in a number amounting to several billion times a million times a hundred thousand, so only a small fraction of them is taught here:
----------
Thus, these concentrations (samādhi) are infinite (ananta) and immeasurable (aprameya), and the excellent (pravarottama) and fearless (nirbhaya) bodhisattvas who have perfected these ten million times a thousand billion meditations (dhyānakoṭinayutapāramiṃgata), these very steadfast (dṛḍhavara) great beings (mahāsattva) understand pure concentration (viśuddhasamādhi).
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable meditation.
(p. 61) 10th Imperishable: Insight.
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra addressed himself to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati: – Well spoken by you, son of good family, was this imperishability of the bodhisattvas’ meditation. May you be inspired, son of good family, on the subject of the imperishability of the bodhisattvas’ insight, as to how the insight of the bodhisattvas becomes imperishable.
Akṣayamati said: – The bodhisattvas’ insight, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is also imperishable. What is the form [or essence (svabhāva) ] of that insight, what is the entrance into it [or, rather, the understanding of the essential character of moments of existence (dharmalakṣaṇa) through that insight]?
Learning is the form, and thorough mental effort is the entrance to it.
So, of what kind then is the form [of insight] consisting in learning, what is the entrance to it,
a) [The essence (svabhāva), form (ākāra) or cause (hetu) of insight (prajñā):] What is the form of learning of the bodhisattvas?It has eighty-four, namely, 1) the form of eagerness;2) the form of intention;3) the form of determination;4) the form of practice;5) the form of spiritual friends;6) the form of no pride;7) the form of no carelessness;8) the form of respect;9) the form of accordance with instruction;10) the form of good speech;11) the form of serving;12) the form of attentive hearing;13) the form of mental effort;14) the form of no divertedness;15) the form of stability;16) the form of having the concept of [learning (śruta), or hearing the true religion (saddharma), as] a jewel;17) the form of having the concept of [learning (śruta) as] a medicine [since learning takes away the three kinds of poison (= rāga, dveṣa, moha) ];18) [and thus it is] the form of appeasement of the sickness of vices;19) the form of vessel of remembrance;20) the form of comprehension through understanding;21) the form of desire for intelligence;22) the form of entering into consciousness;23) the form of never getting tired of listening to the religion of the Buddha;24) the form of increasing renunciation;25) the form of being disciplined and well trained;26) the form of serving those with great learning;27) the form of feeling joy when paying respect;28) the form of feeling well in body;29) the form of happiness in thought;30) the form of indefatigable listening;31) the form of listening to the meaning [which is extinction (nirvāṇa), the fruit of the holy path (āryamārga) ];32) the form of listening to the religious teachings;33) the form of listening to the way of progress [the holy eightfold path (āryâṣṭâṅgamārga), etc.];34) the form of listening to the teachings of others [giving up holding on to one’s own views (svadṛṣṭiparāmarṣa), being thus without conceitedness (nirmāṇa) ];35) the form of listening to what has not been heard before;36) the form of listening to [the teachings on] supernormal powers;37) the form of having no wish for other religious ways;38) the form of listening to [the teachings on] the perfections;39) the form of listening to the collected teachings of the bodhisattvas;40) the form of listening to the [teachings on] ways of attracting beings;41) the form of listening to [teachings on] skill in expedient means;42) the form of listening to [teachings on] pure behaviour;43) the form of listening to [the teachings on] recollection and awareness;44) the form of listening to skill concerning origination;45) the form of listening to skill concerning the unoriginated;46) the form of [meditation on] the ugly;47) the form of friendliness;48) the form of dependent origination [the antidotes of cupidity, aversion and bewilderment (rāgadveṣamohapratipakṣa), which originate from learning (śruta) ];49) the form of impermanence [in the way that all conditioned things are momentary (kṣaṇikaṃ sarve saṃskārāḥ) ];50) the form of suffering;51) the form of egolessness;52) the form of peace;53) the form of emptiness;54) the form of no distinguishing marks;55) the form of nothing to be longed for;56) the form of the unconditioned;57) the form of bringing the good about;58) the form of the magical power of truth;59) the form of non-disappearance [of action and its maturing fruit (karmaphalavipāka) ];60) the form of being self-contained;61) the form of protecting one’s own thoughts [by not doing things not to be done];62) the form of not losing vigour;63) the form of introspection into the moments of existence;64) the form of contrast to vices;65) the form of protecting one’s own position [the position of the bodhisattva, to wit, the pure moments of existence (vaiyavadānikadharma) and the beings belonging to his retinue; (tatparivāraparyāpanna); protecting the position so it will not be attacked by others in the way that it will get into the power of the vices (kleśavaśa) ];66) the form of suppressing the vices and the other positions [of the Evil Ones and the heretics, etc. (māratīrthikâdi) ];67) the form of attaining the seven kinds of [religious] riches;68) [and thus] the form of abolition of all poverty;69) the form of being praised by all the learned;70) the form of being a joy to the wise;(p. 63) 71) the form of being approved by the holy;72) the form of giving faith to the unholy;73) the form of seeing the truth;74) the form of avoiding the imperfections in the parts of the personality;75) the form of considering the imperfections of the conditioned;76) the form of reliance on the meaning;77) the form of reliance on religion;78) the form of reliance on knowledge;79) the form of reliance on explicit meaning;80) the form of not doing any sin;81) the form of doing good both to oneself and the others;82) the form of a good deed [since learning itself is the essence of the good (śrutam eva kuśalasvabhāvaḥ) and thus], also no regret;83) the form of being [gradually] distinguished;[and to conclude] 84) the form of attaining all the qualities of a buddha [as they are all based upon learning (śruta) ].
Those are called the eighty-four forms of learning of the bodhisattvas.
b) [The entrance into insight (prajñāpraveśa), or, rather, how to understand the essential character of moments of existence (dharmalakṣaṇa) through that insight:] And, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the entrances [into the meaning of things as they are (tattvârtha) ] by thorough mental effort are thirty-two.
What thirty-two?
1) The entrance of the state of peaceful meditation;2) the entrance of discernment of expanded vision;3) [peaceful meditation and expanded vision is] the entrance of fitness of thought [being the ability to stay according to one’s wish (yathā kāmatayā) with any object concerned (adhyālambanârtha) ];4) the entrance of aloofness of the body [staying in a place conducive to renunciation like a mountain cave (śailaguhā) or in a forest (vana) ];and 5) the entrance of aloofness of thought [without the thought-constructions of cupidity, etc. (rāgābhilāṣākalpanā) ] [the two items designating the practice of cultivating peaceful meditation and expanded vision (śamathavipaśyanābhāvanāprayogadeśanā) ];6) the entrance of dependent origination;7) the entrance of accordance with truth;8) the entrance of no discontinuity;9) the entrance of no permanence;10) the entrance of causes and conditions;11) the entrance of no self, no animated being, no life-principle, no personality;12) the entrance of no going, coming or remaining;13) the entrance of the non-perishing of [the connection between] causes and effects [that is, actions and their fruits], though there is no transmigration [of any moment of existence whatsoever];14) the entrance of making oneself acquainted with emptiness, no distinguishing marks and absence of anything to long for,but 15) the entrance of not realizing emptiness, absence of distinguishing marks and absence of something to long for;16) the entrance of the way of producing [through insight (prajñā) ] meditation, concentration and states of concentration,but 17) the entrance of not being born by the power of meditation, concentration and states of concentration [but by the power of compassion (karuṇā), having the beings in the sphere of passion (kāmadhātu) in view];18) the entrance into knowledge of supernatural powers [through insight (prajñā) ],but 19) the entrance into not realizing the cessation of the sullied states [through compassion (karuṇā) ];20) the entrance of reflection on inner things,but 21) the entrance of not going into the secure [that is, extinction (nirvāṇa) ];22) the entrance of considering the imperfections of the conditioned,but 23) the entrance of not realizing the unconditioned;(p. 64) 24) the entrance of reflecting on the egolessness of all beings,but 25) the entrance of never giving up great compassion;26) the entrance of looking with fear upon any birth,but 27) the entrance of always assuming any form of being in accordance with intention;28) the entrance of disgust and no cupidity,but 29) the entrance of not realizing the moment of existence which is absence of cupidity [namely extinction (nirvāṇa) ];30) the entrance of equanimity when confronted with the qualities of joy in pleasure,but 31) the entrance of not giving up the joy in true religion;32) [to summarize the way of insight and compassion (prajñākaruṇāmārga) it is taught:] the entrance of appeasement of all discursive thinking and thought-constructions,but 33) the entrance of no appeasement of discursive thinking and thought-constructions as expedient means.
Those are called, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ thirty-two entrances of thorough mental effort.
c) [The entrance of insight (prajñāpraveśa) is called “thorough” (yoni), and now its meaning (artha) is explained, its “etymology” (nirukti):]Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, thorough, this is a word for reasoning,a word for reasonable [the true essence (aviparītasvabhāva) of moments of existence, or, as explained in the preceding paragraph, the holy way or extinction (āryamārganirvāṇa) ],a word for gate into [the meditations (dhyāna), supernormal knowledges (abhijñā), powers (bala) and intrepidities (vaiśāradya) and so on, endless qualities],a word for door into,a word for causes,a word for conditions [by which two the qualities of a Buddha are attained],a word for no cessation,a word for no conflict,a word for equanimity,a word for no grasping,a word for no rejection,a word for no conditions,a word for not leaning on,a word for not being established anywhere,a word for being unchangeable,a word for being unperturbed,a word for being beyond attribution,a word for sameness,a word for never not the same,a word for truth,a word for right,a word for unchanging,a word for not having to be repeated,a word for peaceful,a word for absolutely peaceful,a word for calm,a word for no discursive thinking,[and thus also] a word for not doing away with [the adventitious vices (āgantukakleśa) ],a word for not adding [anything to the originally pure thought (prakṛtiprabhāsvaracitta) because of thorough (yoniśaḥ) understanding],a word for the unimpaired,a word for having no superior,a word for no getting out of,a word for having no contrary,a word for the highest,a word for the real,a word for things being such as they are,a word for not being apart from things such as they are,a word for things being nothing else but what they are,(p. 65) a word for being qua being,a word for never breaking the contact [with awakening (bodhi) ],a word for the limit of being,a word for sameness of the three times,a word for not breaking up into [categories of] three times,a word for consciousness not being attached to forms [which are imagined (parikalpita) by ordinary people (pṛthagjana) ],a word for consciousness not being attached to feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness,a word for consciousness not being attached to the element of earth,and thus a word for consciousness not being attached to the element of water, the element of fire or the element of wind,a word for not being attached to the sphere of eye, form or eye-consciousness,and thus a word for not being attached to the sphere of ear, sound or ear-consciousness, the sphere of nose, smell or nose-consciousness, the sphere of tongue, taste or tongue-consciousness, the sphere of body, tangibles or body consciousness or to the sphere of mind, moments of existence or mind-consciousness,a word for reliance on meaning,a word for reliance on religion,a word for reliance on knowledge,a word for reliance on the explicit meaning.
d) Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, “thorough” is [concerned with] all moments of existence.
[To teach the causes of insight (prajñāhetu), and the fruit which is insight (prajñāphala), it is said:] Why?
As one looks upon selflessness in oneself [that is, in one’s own parts of personality (svôpādānaskandha) ], one should look upon all moments of existence in accordance with reason,as one looks upon selflessness in living beings one should look upon all moments of existence in accordance with reason.Seeing that way is the thorough way of seeing.
“That which is thorough [namely the nature (prakṛti) ] of the sphere of existence is also what is thorough [namely the nature (prakṛti) ] of the sphere of extinction”, as one sees in this way according to sameness and no distinction it is called thorough practice;as one sees the essence of impurity and the essence of purity in this way according to sameness and no distinction it is called thorough practice;as one does not see things in the way of reason and non-reason it is thorough practice.
In short, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the place [or object] of all thorough efforts of the bodhisattvas is living beings.He should not give up [being born in] the places of living beings, nor [think that he by that will] disturb the place [or state] of the [totality of] moments of existence [even though making living beings the object of his great compasssion].That is called the bodhisattvas’ effort of thorough entrance.
[Then, to summarize the above-mentioned form of insight (prajñâkāra), etc., to demonstrate that the fruit of the above-mentioned moments of existence is insight, it is said:] Thus, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the outcome for him [the bodhisattva trained in the above-mentioned imperishabilities] of those forms of religion, forms of learning and efforts of thorough entrance is called insight.
(p. 66)e) [The essence of insight (prajñāsvabhāva), the fact that insight is not polluted by the contraries of insight (prajñāvipakṣa):]Insight, then, does not stay with these sixteen things.What sixteen?
1) It does not stay in the company of ignorance, nor does it stay in the company of formative factors, consciousness, name and form, the six fields of sense-perception, touch, feeling, thirst, grasping, existence, birth, old age and death.
2) It does not stay in the company of cessation of ignorance, nor does it stay in the company of cessation of formative factors, consciousness, name and form, the six fields of sense-perception, touch, feeling, thirst, grasping, existence, birth, old age and death.
3) It does not stay in the company of the view that a true substance [a self] is found [which is the root of all views], nor does it stay in the company of the sixty-two view-points which originate from the root view that a true substance is found.
4) It does not stay in the company of [thinking in categories of] high and low [the result (phala) of the ways of the world mentioned in the following], nor does it stay in the company of the ways of the world, gain and loss, fame and absence of fame, disgrace and praise, pleasure and pain [being the cause (hetu) ].
5) It does not stay in the company of anger, subsequent annoyance, concealing [wrongdoings though reprehended with good will], vexation, grudging [because of others’ good qualities], enviously wishing [something without yielding anything], deception, guile, shamelessness, indecency, swagger, quarreling, infatuation, intoxication [with vices], conceit, pride, arrogance, self-conceit, pride of modesty, conceitedness and pride of being wrong [about one’s own qualities], as it does not stay in the company of any of the mental impurities.
6) It does not stay in the company of the manifestation of subtle or coarse, trifling, average or significant cupidity, aversion or delusion, as it does not stay in the company of any vices.
7) It does not stay in the company of the hindrances and obstructions, darkness of delusion [as basis of all vices], obscurations of clear sight, as it does not stay in the company of any manifestation of moments of existence to be done away with.
8) It does not stay with the impurities of cupidity, quarreling and the Evil Ones consisting in the parts of personality, the vices, in death or in sons of gods, as it does not stay with any actions of the Evil One.
9) It does not stay with attachment of grasping for a self, an animated being, a life-principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit, personality, a man or human, as it does not stay with attachment to any grasping.
10) It does not stay with the hindrances of actions [that is, obstacles to seeing truth (satyadarśanântarāya) in one life caused by bad actions in another life], the hindrances to [obtain] religion, the hindrances of vices, the hindrances of viewpoints, the hindrances to [seeing truth because born in bad] states of existence, the hindrances [to seeing truth when born in good states of existence, that because] of maturation [of previous bad actions] or the hindrances to knowledge, as it does not stay with any connections to rebirth caused by bad habits.
11) It does not stay with thought-constructions, fictions, imaginations, distinguishing marks, objects, whatever is seen, heard, thought or known, as it does not stay with any ties [the three first mentioned] or imputations [the rest].
(p. 67) 12) It does not stay with self, permanence, purity or happiness, as it does not stay with any wrong understanding.
13) It does not stay with the eighty-four thousand kinds of mental behaviour in living beings [the contrary (vipakṣa) ], as it does not stay [with the antidote (pratipakṣa), namely] the eighty-four thousand multitudes of religious teachings.
14) It does not stay with stinginess or generosity, bad or good morality, malice or tolerance, laziness or vigour, distraction or meditation, wrong or right insight, as it does not stay with either the side of perfections, or the contrary of mental activity.
15) It does not stay with the decided or the undecided [when it concerns religious development], nor with the true or false, good or bad, blameworthy or blameless, sullied or unsullied, conditioned or unconditioned, worldly or unworldly, excellent or insignificant, pure or impure, existence or extinction, as it does not stay with contraries or antidotes to any moments of existence.
16) It does not stay with difference in religious ways, difference of living beings, difference of buddha-lands, difference of Buddhas, difference of teachings or difference of congregations, as it does not stay with difference of anything.
17) It does not stay with ignorance or knowledge, consciousness, concealed truth or the highest truth, as it does not stay with mental effort concerned with any distinguishing marks.
Insight is beyond roaming about [among the objects of perception], it has no body [as basis], no characteristics, no distinguishing marks, it is unconditioned,[and, to summarize what is the essence of insight (prajñāsvabhāva), after having explained it extensively: That insight giving up all distinguishing marks (nimitta) being beyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpa) ] does not stay with either mental effort concerned with distinguishing marks, or with thought, mind or consciousness, with bases [or sense-organs (indriya) ], names or distinguishing marks, or with oneness or plurality; insight, reverend Śāradvatīputra, does not stay in the company of those sixteen things.
(p. 68)f) [Thus the essence of insight (prajñāsvabhāva) has been explained, then comes the range of its action:]What then is the range of insight [viz. the objects (ālambana) of, or things (vastu) to be understood by insight]?Skills with eight things.What then are the skills with eight things?
1) Skill with the parts of personality;2) skill with spheres;3) skill with fields;4) skill with truth;5) skill with dependent origination;6) skill with the three times;7) skill with all ways of religious development;8) skill with all moments of existence.
1) What then is the bodhisattva’s skill with the parts of personality [that is, understanding their essential characteristics (lakṣaṇa) and essence (svabhāva) ]?
Pointing them out with allegories;pointing them out with [the allegory of] lumps of foam;pointing them out with bubbles;pointing them out with a mirage;pointing them out with the trunk of the plantain tree;pointing them out with illusion;pointing them out with a dream;pointing them out with an echo;pointing them out with a shadow figure;pointing them out with a reflected image;pointing them out with a magical creation.
Why?
Form is like a lump of foam, and what is like a lump of foam cannot be a self, an animated being, a life-principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit or personality; the essence of a lump of foam is also the essence of form. Skill in this is skill with the parts of personality.
Feelings are like bubbles,perception like a mirage,formative factors like the plantain tree,consciousness like an illusion,and an illusion cannot be a self, an animated being, a life-principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit or personality; the essence of an illusion is also the essence of consciousness.Skill in this is the bodhisattva’s skill with the parts of personality.The parts of personality are like a dream, and a dream cannot be a self, an animated being, a life-principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit or personality; the essence of a dream is also the essence of the parts of personality. Skill in this is the bodhisattva’s skill with the parts of personality.
The parts of personality are like an echo, and an echo is not a self, an animated being, a life-principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit or personality; the essence of an echo is also the essence of the parts of personality. Skill in this is the bodhisattva’s skill with the parts of personality.
The parts of personality are like shadow figures, and a shadow figure is not a self, an animated being, a life-principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit or personality; the essence of a shadow figure is also the essence of the parts of personality. Skill in this is the bodhisattva’s skill with the parts of personality.
The parts of personality are like a reflected image, and a reflected image is not a self, an animated being, a life-principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit or personality; the essence of a reflected image is also the essence of the parts of personality. Skill in this is the bodhisattva’s skill with the parts of personality.
The parts of personality are like a magical creation, and a magical creation is not a self, an animated being, (p. 69) a life-principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit or personality; the essence of a magical creation is also the essence of the parts of personality. Skill in this is the bodhisattva’s skill with the parts of personality [understanding the essential characteristics (lakṣaṇa) of the parts of personality according to the mentioned similes].
The parts of personality are the world, and the world has the essential characteristic of destruction [as related to the root luj-, the world is characterized by destruction in each moment (kṣaṇa) ],[and thus] the essence [namely the essential characteristic (lakṣaṇa)] of the world is essentially impermanent, essentially suffering, essentially empty, essentially selfless, essentially in peace. Skill in this is the bodhisattva’s skill with the parts of personality.
2) What then is the bodhisattva’s skill with the spheres?
The knowledge [beyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpajñāna) ] of entering the sphere of total reality [which is the cause that produces the qualities (dharma) of disciples, isolated buddhas and Buddhas, the powers and intrepidities, etc., having the essential characteristic of being the highest meaning (paramārthalakṣaṇa) ].
Even though the sphere of total reality is [the same as] the element of earth [since the element of earth is not different from total reality because it is, in the highest meaning (paramārthatas), essentially empty], the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of hardness [as this only exists in the wrong (viparīta) understanding of the naive (pṛthagjana) ];even though the sphere of total reality is the element of water, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of moistness;even though the sphere of total reality is the element of fire, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of ripening;even though the sphere of total reality is the element of wind, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of motility.
Even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of the eye, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of seeing;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of the ear, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of hearing;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of the nose, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of smelling;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of tongue, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of tasting;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of body, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of touch;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of mind, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of cognition.
Even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of eye-consciousness, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of recognition of form;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of ear-consciousness, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of recognition of sound;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of nose-consciousness, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of recognition of smell;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of tongue-consciousness, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of recognition of taste;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of body-consciousness, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of recognition of tangibles;even (p. 70) though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of mind-consciousness, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of recognition of moments of existence.
Even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of form, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of being something to be known by eye-consciousness;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of sound, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of being something to be known by ear-consciousness;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of smell, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of being something to be known by nose-consciousness;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of taste, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of being something to be known by tongue-consciousness;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of tangibles, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of being something to be known by body-consciousness;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of moments of existence, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of being something to be known by mind-consciousness.Even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of form, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of what is cognized as form;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of sound, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of what is cognized as sound;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of smell, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of what is cognized as smell;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of taste, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of what is cognized as taste;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of tangibles, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of what is cognized as tangibles;even though the sphere of total reality is the sphere of moments of existence, the sphere of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of what is cognized as moments of existence.The sphere of total reality and the sphere of the self are the same;the sphere of total reality and the world of passion, the world of form and the world of no form are the same;the sphere of total reality and the sphere of existence and the sphere of extinction are the same;the sphere of total reality, the sphere of beings, the sphere of space and the sphere of all moments of existence are the same.
Why are they the same?
They are the same because of their same emptiness,because of their same absence of distinguishing marks,because of their same absence of longing,because of their same absence of formative factors,because of their same absence of birth,because of their same absence of origination,because of their same absence of existence,because of their same homogeneity of all moments of existence,because of their same absence of obscurations,because of their sameness with the sphere of empty space,because of their sameness with the sphere of extinction they are the same.
[To summarize:]Immeasurable is the entrance into the sphere of the conditioned, and also the entrance into the sphere of the unconditioned;entering that teaching through the gate that is the state [or essence, pure and all-pervading] of the sphere of total reality is the bodhisattva’s skill with the spheres.
3) What then is the bodhisattva’s skill with the fields?
The knowledge of entering the field of total reality.
Even though the field of total reality is [the same as] the field of the eye [in that they are both empty, or, the empty essence (śūnyasvabhāva) of the field of the eye is the sphere of total reality (dharmadhātu) ], the field of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of seeing [since, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, this exists only in the wrong understanding of the naive];even though the field of total reality is the field of the ear, the field of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of hearing;even though the field of total reality is the field of the nose, the field of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of smelling;even though the field of total reality is the field of the tongue, the field of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of tasting;even though the field of total reality is the field of the body, the field of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of touch;even though the field of total reality is the field of mind, the field of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of cognition of moments of existence.Even though the field of total reality is the field of form, the field of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of being something to be known by eye-consciousness;even though the field of total reality is the field of sound, the field of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of being something to be known by ear-consciousness;even though the field of total reality is the field of smell, the field of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of being something to be known by nose-consciousness;even though the field of total reality is the field of taste, the field of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of being something to be known by tongue-consciousness;even though the field of total reality is the field of tangibles, the field of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of being something to be known by body-consciousness;even though the field of total reality is the field of moments of existence, the field of total reality does not have the essential characteristic of being something to be known by mind-consciousness.
This is the bodhisattva’s skill with the fields.
Further concerning skill with the fields:
The field of the eye is empty of self and of anything belonging to a self, thus with the field of the ear, the field of the nose, the field of the tongue, the field of the body, the field of mind, the field of forms, the field of sound, the field of smell, the field of taste, the field of tangibles, the field of moments of existence is empty of self and of anything belonging to a self.
[Not only has the noble Akṣayamati examined this emptiness with reasoning (yukti), but also] as the Lord [who really has understood it (adhigamya) ] has said: “The eye is empty of self and anything belonging to a self, that is its essence; and thus with the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, the mind is empty of self and anything belonging to a self, that is its essence; thus with forms, sound, smell, taste, tangibles, a moment of existence is empty of self and anything belonging to a self, that is its essence”.
Thus, he does not bring about any decrease of the fields, neither making the bad moments of existence increase nor the good moments of existence decrease he does not fall into conflicting concepts of good and bad, this is the bodhisattva’s skill with the fields.
Further concerning skill with the fields:
The basis and support of greed in the eye-field is the field of form;whenever the eye sees without greed for form, and one does not realize the moment of existence without greed, this is called the bodhisattva’s skill with the fields.Thus [the basis and support of greed] in the ear-field (p. 72) is the field of sound, in the nose-field the field of smell, in the tongue-field the field of taste, in the body-field the field of tangibles.The basis and support of greed in the mind-field is the field of moments of existence; whenever the mind sees without greed for moments of existence and one does not realize the moment of existence without greed, this is called the bodhisattva’s skill with the fields.
Fields are the fields of the holy and the fields of the unholy.There, the field of the holy is right progress on the way;the field of the unholy is what is in opposition to the way.
Established on the way of the bodhisattvas he produces great compassion towards beings practising things in opposition to the way, and yet he does not give up the field of the way; this is called the bodhisattva’s skill with the fields.
4) What then is the bodhisattva’s skill with truths?
The bodhisattva’s skill with truths consists in four entrances [of understanding or knowledge].Which four entrances?
Knowledge of suffering, knowledge of origin, knowledge of cessation and knowledge of the way.There, knowledge of suffering is the knowledge that the parts of personality are unborn,knowledge of origin is the knowledge that thirst has been vanquished,knowledge of cessation is the non-activity of ignorance and propensities,while knowledge of the way is when one does not impute anything to any moments of existence in that they are the same,that is the bodhisattva’s knowledge of the truths.
When, even though he understands those four truths with that kind of insight and knowledge, he does not realize them – for the sake of living beings – but matures living beings, it is called the bodhisattva’s skill with truths [including both insight and expedient means (prajñopāyaparigṛhīta) ].
Further, the bodhisattva’s truth is of three kinds.
What three?Concealed truth, the highest truth and the truth of essential characteristics.
(p. 73) What is concealed truth?Worldly conventions, all that is expressed with syllables, words and designations.The highest truth is where there is no activity even of thoughts, so how can one speak of that of syllables?The truth of characteristics [which really is the same as the highest truth, a way to understand the highest truth] is that all characteristics have one characteristic, and that one characteristic is the absence of characteristics.
There the bodhisattva does not get tired of teachings of concealed truth [understanding things by insight (prajñā) to be non-existent (abhāva) like an illusion, a dream or a reflection],does not fall into realizing the highest truth [not being concerned, like the disciples, only with the peace of extinction and suchness (tathatā) ];even though understanding the one truth by means of the truth of characteristics he matures living beings;this called the bodhisattva’s skill with truths [including both insight and expedient means (prajñopāyaparigṛhīta) ].
Further, truth is of two kinds.What two?Truth of conventions [to teach the holy way (āryamārga), or things known through worldly knowledge (laukikajñāna) ], and the highest truth [to teach the fruit of the way, (mārgaphala), or things known through supramundane knowledge (lokottarajñāna) ].
[Non-confused (abhrānta) and pure worldly knowledge attained after the experience (pṛṣṭhalabdhaṃ laukikaṃ jñānam):] The truth of conventions is speaking the truth at the time [one comes back from concentration beyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpasamādhi), explaining the truths as experienced to mature those to be educated], the truth of suffering, the truth of origin, the truth of cessation and the truth of the way;[and confused (bhrānta) worldly knowledge:] the conventions of the world, all that is expressed with syllables, sounds and designations.The highest truth is the moment of existence never lost, extinction.Why?Because it is always the state of things such as they are,because the essence of that [state of things] is always there.
[Including both insight and expedient means (prajñopāyaparigṛhīta):] There the bodhisattva does not get tired of conventional truth, and does not fall into realizing the highest truth, but matures living beings; this is called the bodhisattva’s skill with truths.
Further, truth is one, there is no second.The one truth is not to impute anything to any moment of existence, but to bring living beings who have fallen into such imputation to truth.
[Insight and expedient means (prajñopāya):] There the bodhisattva does not get tired of teachings imputed [with existence and non-existence], and does not realize the one truth of non-imputation, but matures living beings;this is called the bodhisattva’s skill with truths.
Further [to elucidate the four truths mentioned above], the five parts of personality are filled with suffering; the essential character of the five parts of personality is suffering.When one understands that essential character of suffering to be empty [and not like a substance (sadbhāva) as the disciples believe], this is the holy truth of knowledge of suffering as suffering.
The proclivity of thirst as a cause and view-points as a cause for the five parts of personality is the origin in question.When one does not grasp, impute [existence or non-existence] to, or touch the cause of thirst and the cause of view-points, this is the holy truth of knowledge of origin as origin.
That the five parts of personality have completely perished and ceased, not being born in the beginning, not dying in the end and not possible to reach in the present, this is the holy truth of cessation.When one knows it in this way, this is the holy truth of knowledge of cessation as cessation.
The way relying on which one touches the knowledge of suffering, the knowledge of origin and the knowledge of cessation [that is, one does not see suffering and origin as the negative side (kṛṣṇapakṣa) and cessation as the positive side (śuklapakṣa) ], but cultivates knowledge without conflicts, this is (p. 74) the holy truth of the way to cessation of suffering.Knowledge of emptiness in this is the holy truth of knowledge of the way as the way.
[To summarize:] When he sees the four holy truths with such knowledge, and does not see them through thought-constructions regarding truths, this is called the bodhisattva’s skill with truths.
Further, [to teach the four truths in other aspects:] all feelings are suffering, this is the suffering in question.One discerns feeling and knows it through knowledge, this is the holy truth of knowledge of suffering as suffering.The cause by which that feeling arises is called origin, and that [insight (prajñā) ] by which this cause is known as it is, this is the holy truth of knowledge of origin as origin.When one interrupts every feeling and experiences non-feeling, and, though regarding the cessation of feeling, one does not realize the cessation of feeling, for the sake of living beings, this is the holy truth of knowledge of cessation as cessation.The feeling by which the way is realized is like a raft, while desire for feeling is not desire for the way. This is the holy truth of knowledge of the way as the way.
[To summarize:] When he sees the four holy truths in this way and sees them as the same because of purity, it is called the bodhisattva’s skill with truths.
Further, [to teach yet another repetition of the four truths, to teach in brief what is the essence (svabhāva) of suffering, etc.:]In short, birth is suffering, this is the suffering in question, while knowledge of seeing non-birth is the holy truth of knowledge of suffering as suffering.Because of the condition of existence, there is birth, existence is the origin; knowledge of the inexistence of existence is the holy truth of knowledge of the origin as the origin.All birth is without birth, non-birth is cessation, but in what is unborn there is no cessation; knowledge of no cessation is the holy truth of disappearance and cessation.The knowledge which consists in that kind of calculating, considering, seeking, penetrating and entering, this is the holy truth of knowledge of the way as the way.
[To summarize:] When he enters this knowledge of truths, but does not remain in the knowledge of truths, it is called the bodhisattva’s skill with truths.
(p. 75) 5) What then is the bodhisattva’s skill with dependent origination?
[Dependent origination in the regular way (anuloma), to teach the bewilderment (moha) in entering existence; (saṃsāra);it should be known through the character of its division into members (aṅgavibhāgalakṣaṇatas):]From the origin of being superficial [having concepts of permanence with regard to the impermanent (anitye nityasaṃjñā), pleasure with regard to suffering (duḥkhe sukhasaṃjñā), purity with regard to the impure (aśubhe śubhasaṃjñā), self with regard to the selfless (anātmīye ātmasaṃjñā) ] ignorance originates,from the origin of ignorance formative factors originate,from the origin of formative factors consciousness originates,from the origin of consciousness name and form originate,from the origin of name and form the six senses originate,from the origin of the six senses touch originates,from the origin of touch feeling originates,from the origin of feeling thirst originates,from the origin of thirst grasping originates,from the origin of grasping existence originates,from the origin of existence birth originates,from the origin of birth ageing, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, depression and despair originate.thus this great mass of utter suffering originates.
[Teaching it according to the character of being without a self but arising from conditions (anātmapratyayotpannalakṣaṇatas):]The moments of existence originate in their proper places without movement, inactive, without an owner, not as something to be owned.Knowledge concerning this is the bodhisattva’s skill with dependent origination.
Further, what is caused by the good [such as birth as a god or human being in the sphere of passion (kāmadhātu) ], caused by the bad [such as birth in the three evil destinies (apāya) of the sphere of passion (kāmadhātu) ], caused by the neutral [or immovable actions of meditation (dhyāna) and states of concentration (samāpatti), causing birth in the worlds of form and the formless worlds, (rūpârūpyaloka), not being moved by the wind of thought-constructions (vikalpa), etc.], what is causing existence, what is causing extinction [namely, the holy ways (āryamārga) ], all of that the bodhisattva knows as it is:“The being that makes into his authority an understanding caused by [the mentioned] abilities [good, bad, etc.], he has those abilities as cause, (p. 76) and having his actions as cause he effects completion [of the actions] in accordance with the fruit as [a final] cause.” Thus skill with birth as having the origin in causes among moments of existence acquired or not yet acquired is called the bodhisattva’s skill with dependent origination.
Further, skill with dependent origination is:
[Dependent origination in the reverse way (pratiloma), to teach going out of existence, namely extinction (nirvāṇa):]From cessation of being superficial comes cessation of ignorance,from cessation of ignorance comes cessation of formative factors,from cessation of formative factors comes cessation of consciousness,from cessation of consciousness comes cessation of name and form,from cessation of name and form comes cessation of the six senses,from cessation of the six senses comes cessation of touch,from cessation of touch comes cessation of feeling,from cessation of feeling comes cessation of thirst,from cessation of thirst comes cessation of grasping,from cessation of grasping comes cessation of existence,from cessation of existence comes cessation of birth,from cessation of birth ageing, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, depression and despair cease,thus this great mass of utter suffering ceases.
The moments of existence cease in their proper places without movement, inactive, without an owner, not as something to be owned.Skill in this is the bodhisattva’s skill with dependent origination.
Further, all moments of existence are dependent on causes, dependent on conditions, dependent on combinations of these.And the moments of existence that are dependent on causes, conditions and their combinations are not dependent on a self, a being, a soul or a person.What is not dependent on a self, a being, a soul or a person, no calculation like “here”, “before” or “other place” belongs to that.When he considers things in this way it is the bodhisattva’s skill with dependent origination.
Further, [to teach knowledge of dependent origination avoiding the two extremes (antadvayavivarjita):] when the bodhisattva produces all the conditions for awakening, and then sees the destruction and cessation of those conditions [that they really are empty], but does not get stuck in the knowledge of their destruction and cessation, out of regard for living beings, it is called the bodhisattva’s skill with dependent origination.
(p. 77) 6) What then is the bodhisattva’s skill with the three times?
Remembering one’s own and other beings’ past thoughts and contents of thought, good and bad; and having remembered, rejecting bad thoughts and contents of thought; having remembered, transforming into awakening the good thoughts and contents of thought; this is skill with the past.
Being absorbed in future roots of the good, being thoughts and contents of thoughts, concentrating on making awakening present [in the following way]: “I will transform into incomparable perfect awakening all appearances of good thoughts and contents of thought that appear in me, and I will give the bad thoughts and contents of thought no chance,” cultivating thought in this way is skill with the future.
What then is skill with the present? Producing roots of the good with correct practice in present thoughts and contents of thought, banishing bad thoughts and contents of thought, making good thoughts and contents of thought present for the sake of awakening, is skill with the present.
Skill in these things is the bodhisattva’s skill with the three times.
Further, [to understand rightly with insight (prajñā) and expedient means (upāya) the things in the three times it is said:] confidence in the fact that the moments of existence of the past are empty, confidence in the fact that the moments of existence of the future are empty, confidence in the fact that the moments of existence of the present are empty – though one considers the emptiness of the three times thus with insight and knowledge, one rejoices in the knowledge of expedient means resulting from all the merit of the Buddhas past, present and future – skill in this is the bodhisattva’s skill with the three times.
Further, though he sees that the moments of existence of the past [really (svabhāvena) ] have perished and do not perish in the future [as there is no connection to the future (paścimâpratisaṃdhi) ], he does not slacken his vigour to bring about the good, he does not bring the bad about;though he considers the moments of existence of the future to be unborn and inexistent, he does not give up his vigour in transforming into awakening;though he considers the moments of existence in the present to be not remaining, not abiding, the bodhisattva, very firm in his determination, does not forget the thought of awakening [though this also, according to the highest truth (paramārtha), is not abiding].This is called the bodhisattva’s skill with the three times.
Further, the past has perished, the future is not reached, and the present does not abide,when one considers thought and the contents of thought thus as born, destroyed and melted away, but still acquires the roots of good that bring awakening about, this is called the bodhisattva’s skill with the three times.
Further, remembering the past by means of skill in supernormal knowledge, and, having remembered roots of the good planted in the past, transforming them into awakening;knowledge of future productions of good thoughts and then fulfilling one’s vows;applying mental effort and making roots of the good stay as they arise in the present, transforming them into awakening;this is skill with the three times.
(p. 78) Further, he matures living beings the way they are to be matured, remembering the acquisition of merit in the past for the sake of maturing all living beings;he matures accordingly all living beings in the future who are to be matured by paying respect to the Buddhas;and he matures all those living beings of the present who are to be matured by the miracles of teaching religion and magic.
[To summarize], when he in these three times fulfils his own aims, others’ aims and the aim of awakening by way of non-attachment [that is, by way of threefold purity (trimaṇḍalapariśuddhinayena), consisting in not grasping for substance (bhāva) in any of the three aspects, to wit one’s own aims, others’ aims and the aim of awakening], it is called the bodhisattva’s skill with the three times.
7) What then is the bodhisattva’s skill with all the ways?
These three ways are conducive to deliverance. Which three? The way of disciples, the way of isolated buddhas and the great way.
Further, the ways are two. Which two? The way of the gods and the way of men.
What then is the bodhisattva’s skill with the way of disciples? (p. 79)
[1. Its basis (āśraya):] When the Buddhas are not born there is no way of disciples.
[2. Its scope (ālambana):] Why? The right view of the disciples [the view of no self in the personality (pudgalanairātmya) ] is the consequence of the words of others [taught by a Buddha, teacher or preceptor (buddhâcāryôpādhyāya) ].
[3. Its cause (hetu):] There, hearing is concerned with the vow of moral discipline, so that the mass of moral discipline – which is following what the rules declare – is fulfilled.
[4. Progress (pratipatti):] Having fulfilled the mass of moral discipline he fulfils the mass of concentration [as thought becomes one-pointed depending on moral discipline].
Having fulfilled the mass of concentration he fulfils the mass of insight [into the four truths, as true insight arises from one-pointedness].
[5. Its fruit (phala):] Having fulfilled the mass of insight he fulfils the mass of deliverance [as he realizes the elimination of the vices by means of pure knowledge (suviśuddhajñānena klesaprahāṇaṃ sākṣātkaroti) ].
[6. Knowledge of it (tatpravedanā):] Having fulfilled the mass of deliverance he fulfils the mass of vision of the knowledge of deliverance [thus having freed thought from the vices of the threefold world he knows deliverance itself].
Skill in this is called skill with the way of disciples.
Further, skill with the way of disciples is [1. counteracting the adversary (vipakṣadūṣaṇa) ] rejecting the formative factors, meritorious, non-meritorious or neutral;disgust and absence of passion for the whole threefold world;discerning the impermanence and suffering in all conditioned things;discerning the egolessness in all moments of existence;delight in peace and extinction;no desire for birth in existence, not even for a second;regarding [existence (bhava) ] always with fear;constant absence of security [regarding existence (bhava) ];conceiving of the parts of personality as a killer;conceiving of the spheres of sense-perception as snake-venom;conceiving of the fields of sense-perception as an empty village;conceiving no wishes regarding any kind of birth;[and 2. seeing the good qualities of the stage of the antidote (pratipakṣabhūmiguṇadarśitā):] conceiving of extinction as one’s proper abode, one’s refuge.
Teaching and explaining thus is called the bodhisattva’s skill with the way of disciples.
What then is the bodhisattva’s skill with the way of isolated buddhas?
The forms [or rather, causes (hetu) ] and conditions by which the isolated buddhas escape the world, these the bodhisattva knows as they are.What are they?
[1. The causes (hetu) are:]Heaping up the accumulation of merit from giving, heaping up the accumulation of merit from morality, not like that of the disciples, but caused by great eagerness, vigour and absence of negligence;progress in religion with little learning;no despondency in serving the Lords and Buddhas;having medium abilities;being always bent on the ascetic life;having small ambitions [namely, one’s own peace, liberation and extinction], and doing few things [for others’ peace and extinction because of small compassion, making no effort for the sake of this];[having few vices] being [bodily] displeased with social life, [mental] delight in solitude [being far from the thought-constructions of cupidity and aversion (rāgadveṣavikalpa) ],having lodgings in solitude [e. g. under a tree or in a cave].
[2. The conditions (pratyaya) are:]being difficult to overpower [having few vices and great virtue];having great magical power;being delighted by [the fruit of religious practice] the stage where one is to be honoured [namely, that of an arhat];continuous reflection on dependent origination;having in view the one sphere which is deliverance;transcending [the three worlds (traidhātuka) ] by means of self-originated knowledge.
[3. The fruit (phala) is:]Attaining the [ability of] entering [by means of concentration] an object [of meditation, like dependent origination];continuity of the meditations, deliverances, concentrations and states of concentration;producing knowledge [of the unborn] which is not dependent on the instructions of others;awakening to the knowledge of conditions involved with any object.
Expounding, teaching and explaining thus is called the bodhisattva’s skill with the way of isolated buddhas.
(p. 80) What then is the bodhisattva’s skill with the great way? The bodhisattva’s skill with the great way is immeasurable, so only an indication of it is taught.
That way is immeasurable since it opens up a possibility for all living beings;that way is unhindered being bent upon unattached knowledge;that way is the accumulation of all merit and roots of good, and thus nourishes all beings;that way is the fulfilment of all the perfections since it relates to the mental behaviour of all beings;that way is attaining the accumulation of knowledge which leads to omniscience since it is going unhindered to the place of awakening;that way emits unhindered rays of light similarly on all beings since all beings are to be honoured;that way is beyond fear of any bad ways since all qualities of a Buddha are made manifest;that way vanquishes all the assemblies of the Evil One, antagonists and bad teachers as it flies the flags and banners of the conditions conducive to awakening and dependent origination;that way does away with all viewpoints concerning limits or absence of limits, eternalism or nihilism, existence or nonexistence, [and further,] the appearance [of vices], hindrances, obstructions, doubt and regret, as it is the unhindered Buddha-way;that way possesses all the parts of religious practice, the attainment of possessing all jewels [being religious ways], traversing the true way [leading to the extinction which is found nowhere (apratiṣṭhitanirvāṇa) ], it nourishes all beings, since it is distinguished by its great determination and compassion;that way is adorned with ornaments for body, speech and mind, being the ten powers, the intrepidities, and the special qualities of the Buddha and the characteristics and marks of beauty [on the body], and so it is faultless.
Skill in this is the bodhisattva’s skill with the great way.
(p. 81) 8) What then is the bodhisattva’s skill with all moments of existence?
All moments of existence are, in short, a) conditioned, and b) unconditioned, so the bodhisattva should develop skill with the conditioned and the unconditioned.
So what then is the bodhisattva’s skill with the conditioned?
When he transforms into incomparable complete awakening all those conditioned things which consist in the good formative factors in the body, the good formative factors in speech, and the good formative factors in the mind, it is the bodhisattva’s skill with the conditioned.And again, when he transforms into omniscience all those conditioned things which consist in the good formative factors in body, speech and mind by understanding them as [essentially the same as] awakening, this is his skill with the unconditioned.
Further, skill with the conditioned is the fivefold accomplishment of the perfections.Which five?The perfection of generosity, the perfection of morality, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of vigour, the perfection of meditation. This is called the bodhisattva’s skill with the conditioned.And again, when he, through the perfection of insight – the knowledge of the unconditioned – does not depreciate the other five perfections [though inferior in causing birth in existence (saṃsāra) ], but transforms them into omniscience, and into the bodhisattva’s unsullied liberation – for the sake of accumulating all the perfections and heaping up roots of good – this is his skill with the unconditioned.
Further concerning skill with the conditioned: when he attracts beings with the four means of attraction so as to emit unhindered rays of light equally upon all living beings, this is the bodhisattva’s skill with the conditioned.And again, when he does not grasp, cling or adhere to things by the principle that they are without soul or self, when he relies on the skill in the ways of attracting beings as being unconditioned, when he transforms them into omniscience, this is his skill with the unconditioned.
Further concerning skill with the conditioned: when he cuts off the vices in the stream of existence, but does not cut off the roots of good in the stream of existence, when he fastens the fetters which consist in the realization of awakening, but does not concern himself with the fetters that bind those with limited religious practice, this is skill with the conditioned.And again, skill in discerning what is knowledge acquainted with emptiness, absence of distinguishing marks and longing, (p. 82) not being taught by others concerning awakening, not realizing the unconditioned, this is his skill with the unconditioned.
Further concerning skill with the conditioned: though he roams about in the three worlds, he does not get sullied by the vices connected with roaming about in the three worlds [like the lotus born from the mud does not get sullied by the mud], this is skill with the conditioned.Though he has knowledge of deliverance from the threefold world, he does not fall into the sphere of deliverance, this is his skill with the unconditioned.
[To summarize, firstly, what is the explanation of the word (nirvacana):] That which is called skill with all moments of existence is another word for omniscience.[And secondly, the reason for this (hetu):] Why?One fulfils [thirdly in the summary, the fruit (phala), viz.] the immeasurable and unattached knowledge of omniscience with skill in continuous recollection, intelligence and insight; that is why it is called skill with all moments of existence.
Reverend Śāradvatīputra, the insight of the bodhisattvas possessing those eight skills becomes imperishable.
g) [The action of insight (prajñākarma):]Further, insight is knowledge of what are good and bad moments of existence;insight is discerning the moments of existence conducive to spiritual progress;insight is authoritative since the holy principles of religion [namely egolessness of the person and egolessness of moments of existence] are made manifest by it;insight is understanding all doctrinal viewpoints, manifestations of vices, hindrances and obstructions such as they are [namely, essentially empty (svabhāvaśūnya) ];insight is having no longings concerned with cupidity, hopes and wishes;insight creates pleasure since it quenches the fire of all vices;insight creates joy since it is the unbrokenness of happiness and joy concerning religion;insight throws light upon things since it makes manifest the knowledge of the meaning [namely, the limit of existence (bhūtakoṭi), the pure total reality (viśuddhadharmadhātu), etc.];insight is the basis of the thirty-seven moments of existence which are the wings of awakening;insight has the essential characteristic of attainment since it attains the fruit according to the way;insight has the essential characteristic of knowing [the special and general characteristics (svasāmānyalakṣaṇa) of moments of existence] since knowledge is essentially radiant;insight is saving since it brings you over all the floods [of cupidity (rāga), viewpoints (dṛṣṭi), ignorance (avidyā) and existence (bhava) ];insight leads to true certainty;insight embraces all good moments of existence [as they arise from it];insight (p. 83) clears up all earlier vices and bad habits;insight is the most excellent of the prominent moments of existence;insight is most sublime since it is understanding through self-originated knowledge;insight is beyond appearance since it is not stained by the threefold world;[but still] insight has grasped expedient means in every way;insight has been attained by all the holy;insight cannot be grasped by any logical standard since it is the absence of distinguishing marks and thought-constructions;insight is the adversary of indolence since it is the absence of the darkness of ignorance and delusion;insight is the practice of all those established on the stage of practising meditation;insight is the leader of the adherents of all the ways;insight makes light since it removes the obscured vision, the darkness of ignorance and delusion;insight gives sight accordingly to those wishing sight [be it the sight of insight (prajñācakṣur), the sight of the Buddhas (buddhacakṣur) or the sight of moments of existence (dharmacakṣur) ];insight has no basis since it transcends the way of eye and form, and likewise transcends the way of ears and sound, nose and smell, tongue and taste, body and tangibles, mind and moments of existence;insight is the highest meaning since it issues from truth;insight is the imperturbability of the well-trained;insight is the splendour in the gates of knowledge;insight is imperishable as it moves about everywhere;insight is unhindered as it is the vision of the entrance into dependent origination;insight is the way of liberation since it is the severing of all the bonds of grasping and the vices;insight is not stained by any vices;insight does not stay in any company [as the sixteen things mentioned above] with moments of existence making or going to make hindrances.
As many as are the mental actions of all beings, so many are the actions of insight and knowledge;as many as are the vices and bad habits of all beings, so great is the knowledge consisting in the consideration by insight;as many as are the gates into the vices of all beings, so many are the gates to enter insight;as great as is the insight of the disciples, the isolated buddhas, the bodhisattvas and the Perfect Buddhas, so great is the foundation and basis of insight.The bodhisattva should train himself in this.
[To summarize the meaning of the extensive teaching on imperishability of insight above, the fruit of insight (prajñāphala):] That, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the bodhisattvas’ imperishability of insight, and by this imperishable insight the bodhisattvas attain the [fruit (phala), that is,] imperishability of [non-dual] knowledge [beyond subject and object].
[Showing the greatness of the teaching (nirdeśamahâtmyanirdeśa):] When this chapter on the exposition of the imperishability of insight was taught, thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas who had made their preparations in the past attained the tolerance that all moments of existence are unborn.
(p. 84) VI. Pity
11th Imperishable: Friendliness.
Then the bodhisattva Akṣayamati addressed himself to the venerable Śāradvatīputra and said:
– [1. Since the object it takes into consideration (ālambanīya) is immeasurable (apramāṇa), it is, taking that object into consideration (ālambika) immeasurable itself:] The friendliness of the bodhisattvas, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is also imperishable.
Why? Because it is boundless.The friendliness of the bodhisattvas should be known as boundless, their presentation of friendliness is unbroken.
Thus, as great as the sphere of living beings may be, that much the bodhisattva pervades in producing thoughts of friendliness.
Just as, reverend Śāradvatīputra, there is no place which is not pervaded by space, just so, reverend Śāradvatīputra, there is no being who is not pervaded by the friendliness of the bodhisattva.Just as the sphere of beings is immeasurable – there is no exhaustion of it – just so the bodhisattva’s cultivation of friendliness is immeasurable – and in that there is no exhaustion.Thus, as space is imperishable, living beings are imperishable, and since living beings are imperishable, friendliness is imperishable; that is why the friendliness of those good men is said to be imperishable.
Thus addressed, the elder Śāradvatīputra again asked the bodhisattva Akṣayamati:
How great then, son of good family, is the sphere of living beings?
Akṣayamati said: – As great, reverend Śāradvatīputra, as is the sphere of earth, the sphere of water, the sphere of fire and the sphere of air, even greater than that is the sphere of living beings.
Said he again: – But, son of good family, is it possible to express it by examples?
Akṣayamati said: – Though it is possible, reverend Śāradvatīputra, no limited means of demonstration will do.
(p. 85) It is, reverend Śāradvatīputra, as if world-spheres as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā in the eastern direction, thus in the southern direction, thus in the western direction and thus in the northern direction, as if world-spheres as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā in each of the ten directions all were filled with the waters of the great ocean and made into one, if living beings as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā came together and took out of it one drop of water with a tip of a strand of hair split a hundred times, and then, if living beings as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā came together after a period of world-ages as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā and took out a second drop of water with a tip of a strand of hair split a hundred times, if by this way of establishing distinguishing marks, by this way of calculating, if once in a period of time consisting of world-ages as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā a drop of water was taken out by living beings as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā with a tip of a strand of hair split a hundred times, one by one, even though such a great mass of water would be exhausted, there would be no exhaustion or diminution in the sphere of living beings.
Thus, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the sphere of living beings is immeasurable, but the bodhisattva pervades them all with friendliness.
What do you think, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the destruction of the immeasurable roots of good stemming from the cultivation of such friendliness possible?
Said he: – Not at all, son of good family, he would hold that space could perish who holds that such roots of good stemming from the cultivation of friendliness could perish.And the bodhisattvas who do not get scared having heard this, distinguish themselves through the imperishability of friendliness.
[2. Its action (karman):] Akṣayamati said:
– Friendliness is protection for oneself [since the friendly have no enemies to hurt them, and they have no aversion] and practice for the benefit of others;absence of quarreling;destroying all ill-will, harshness, aversion, rage and malice;absence of bad habits and manifestations of vices,and producing joy,not seeing the mistakes of any being;bringing pleasure to body and thought, leaving them untormented,and also beyond the violence of others;absence of fear for anything bad,and accordance with the holy way,making happy beings with paranoid and enraged thoughts;setting free from any conflict;[through vanquishing the Evil One and opponents with the concentration on friendliness (maitrīsamādhi) and thus] not carrying club or sword;joy by liberating all beings;absence of all aversion;absence of hypocrisy, boasting or threats [for the sake of gain].
[3. Its fruit (phala):] It is the producer of all kinds of wealth, honour and fame;honoured by all, the king of the gods, the lord of the world and the protectors of the world;adorned with the ornament of its own splendour;praised by the wise;protecting the simple-minded;in accordance with the way of Brahmā;not polluted by the sphere of cupidity;the excellent way of liberation for all beings;all ways of religious development are embodied in it;it attains non-material [and thus liberating] merit;it accumulates the multitude of all merit;is is not surpassed even by all merit produced by material things;adorned with the thirty-two characteristics of a great man and (p. 86) the eighty marks of beauty;avoiding birth with weak or imperfect sense-abilities;in accordance with the way that leads to fortunate birth [as a human or a god], and then to extinction;and avoiding birth in the eight untimely states of birth.
[4. Its essence (svabhāva):] Delight in the joy of [emptiness, the truth in] religion [or in the practice of religion][and thus] no joy in pleasures, food and power;the same thoughts towards all beings,making no distinctions in the practice of generosity;the way into morality and rules of conduct,but protecting [from the bad] all with bad morality [and helping them to reach the good],showing the power of tolerance,no conceit, infatuation or arrogance;carrying through to the end all actions of right practice by undertaking imperturbable vigour;the root of the meditations, concentrations and states of meditation which the holy enter;deliverance from all vices by the meditations, liberations, concentrations and states of concentration;bringing about the causes of introspection and insight by retaining learning in sacred formulas;certainty of one’s own position of [purity (vyavadāna) ] and the other position [of evil and vices (mārakleśa) ],doing away with the position of evil and vices;pleasant to stay with;pondering the result of serving and progressing [on the stages (bhūmi) and in the moments of existence which are the wings of awakening (bodhipakṣikadharma) ];guarding one’s behaviour,transcending all frivolity [in such a way that the senses (indriya) and consciousness (vijñāna) do not enter the outer objects (viṣaya), but stay in peace];cessation of conceited action,being anointed with conscience regarding oneself and when confronted with others, and thus fragrant;and purification of the foul smell of the fetters of impressions and vices.
[5. Its excellence (viśeṣa):] Friendliness, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is protecting all beings, great friendliness is giving up one’s own pleasure and giving pleasure to living beings.The friendliness of the disciples is to protect oneself, the great friendliness of the bodhisattvas is to protect all beings.
Friendliness, reverend Śāradvatīputra, takes you out of the stream of existence.
[6. The different kinds (prabheda):] Friendliness, reverend Śāradvatīputra, consists in these three things. What three? 1) Friendliness with living beings as the object, 2) friendliness with moments of existence as the object, and 3) friendliness without object.
1) Friendliness with living beings as the object pertains to the bodhisattvas who have produced the thought of awakening for the first time;
2) friendliness with moments of existence as the object pertains to the bodhisattvas whose practice is in progress;
3) friendliness without object pertains to the bodhisattvas who have attained the tolerance that all moments of existence are unborn.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable friendliness.
12th Imperishable: Compassion.(p. 87)
[1. The highest of all the Buddha’s qualities (agrabhūtā sarvabuddhadharmāṇām):] Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ great compassion is also imperishable. Why? Because it is a prerequisite.
As, reverend Śāradvatīputra, breathing in and (p. 88) out is a prerequisite to the power of life in man, just so, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is great compassion a prerequisite to the bodhisattva’s accomplishment of the great way.
As the precious wheel of power belonging to the universal king is a prerequisite to the seven kinds of wealth, just so great compassion is a prerequisite to the bodhisattva’s accomplishment of the knowledge of omniscience.
As a rich man or householder has heartfelt love for his only virtuous son, just so the bodhisattva with great compassion has heartfelt love for all beings.
[2. Etymology (nirukti):] As for this great compassion, reverend Śāradvatīputra, [the meaning of the word compassion is “work” (tasyāḥ karuṇāyāḥ śabdārthaḥ karaṇeti), and all roots of the good are] work performed by oneself, thus it is called great compassion;[even if it is for the sake of both others and oneself] it is one’s own work, thus it is called great compassion;it is the absence of authority over others [setting them to work], thus it is called great compassion.
[3. Its cause (hetu) and essence (svabhāva):] Great compassion is action according to intention, since it has its origin in the absence of fraud;great compassion is the practice [completing everything] since it has its origin in the absence of deception;great compassion is action according to determination since it has its origin in never turning back;great compassion is essential knowledge since it has its origin in the non-artificial;great compassion is essentially pure since it has its origin in the right way;great compassion is thought without crookedness since it has its origin in the unambiguous;great compassion is without conceit since it has its origin in humbleness towards all beings;great compassion originates as immeasurable since the number of beings is immeasurable;great compassion is disregard for one’s own body since it has its origin in [the cause which is to have as the object (ālambanahetu) ] the attainment of the body of a Tathāgata;great compassion is not to seek safety of life since it has its origin in never doing anything sinful [even to save one’s own life];great compassion is protecting others since it has its origin in the thought of awakening;great compassion is protecting living beings since it has its origin in the purity of one’s own thoughts [not wishing to harm];great compassion is to have regard for the poor, the suffering and the unprotected since it has its origin in taking away the suffering of all beings;great compassion is firm promise since it has its origin in an unchangeable mind;great compassion is seeing truth since it has its origin in not breaking one’s word to either oneself, the Buddha or a divinity [guarding one’s morality];great compassion is pure conduct since it has its origin in deeds well done;great compassion is giving up one’s own pleasure since it has its origin in giving pleasure to others;great compassion is placing others in pleasure since it has its origin in the absence of thirst;great compassion carries the burdens [of suffering] of all beings since it has its origin in undertaking firm vigour;great compassion is taking upon oneself superior tolerance since it has its origin in patience with the faults of weak beings;great compassion is taking away praise and blame since it has its origin in serving the sick;great compassion is the attainment of mastery of religion since it has its origin in maturing living beings whose intentions are weak;great compassion is to conceal one’s own good qualities since it has its origin in praising the qualities of others;great compassion is enduring any suffering since it has its origin in wanting unsullied pleasure;great compassion is giving things to beggars since it has its origin in good deeds and the absence of remorse;(p. 89) great compassion has its origin in well-guarded morality since it has its origin in protecting beings with bad morality;great compassion is endurance of bodily pain since it has its origin in the attainment of the adamantine body;great compassion is maturing living beings since it has its origin in the absence regard for one’s body or life;great compassion has no regard [for oneself] since it has its origin in giving away even one’s limbs and extremities;great compassion produces roots of the good in other beings since it has its origin in the absence of desire for one’s own roots of good [transforming them for the good of others, not accumulating roots of good for oneself];great compassion is not tasting the pleasure of meditation since it has its origin in again having the sphere of desire as the object [seeking rebirth in the sphere of desire for the sake of the beings there, giving up the pleasure of the sphere of forms (rūpadhātu) ];great compassion is illuminating everywhere [having all things to be known (jñeya) as its object], since it has its origin in the light of unhindered knowledge;great compassion has no special regard for [or, is not dependent on] insight since it has its origin in not deriding the roots of good or accumulations of merit anywhere;great compassion is shared out everywhere since it has its origin in fulfilling the wishes of all beings;great compassion is liberating all beings [placing them in extinction according to one’s first thought of awakening (prathamabodhicittotpāda) ] since it has its origin in not abandoning one’s former vows;great compassion is not concerned with the unconditioned since it has its origin in maturing living beings in the conditioned;great compassion has regard for beings with bad morality since it is establishing beings in the morality of the Buddha.
[4. Its action (karman):] Thus, reverend Śāradvatīputra, any liberation whatsoever [from vices, from the threefold world] of the bodhisattva originates from great compassion [thus compassion produces (evaṃ karuṇôtpādayati), and, since it is something that effects action (yasmāt kāryakāraṇam) ], that is why it is called great compassion.[What then does it effect (kiṃ kārayati)?] Thus great compassion is what effects generosity, effects morality, effects tolerance, effects vigour, effects meditation, effects insight, effects expedient means, effects all moments of existence that are wings of awakening.Great compassion is what effects the accomplishment of self-existent knowledge, effects good deeds, effects absence of regret, effects the necessary.It has its origin in being engaged in whatever action is necessary for all beings, thus it is called great compassion.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ great compassion.
(p. 90) 13th Imperishable: Joy.
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the great joy of the bodhisattvas is also imperishable.What then is great joy?
It is gladness, harmony and delight resulting from remembrance and recollection of the qualities of a Buddha;absence of dejection and depression in thought;absence of thirst for pleasure;doing away with all delight in pleasure,it is the basis of all delight in religion;delight in thought, excitement in body, fascination of the intellect and happiness of mind;the joy and delight caused by the body of the Tathāgata and skill in searching for his ornaments consisting in the primary characteristics and the secondary marks of beauty;absence of fatigue when listening to the good religion;gladness, harmony and delight in the accomplishment of confidence in the essential moments of existence,the happiness of the one thus delighted with regard to these moments of existence;always to have a mind free from aversion towards living beings,and intense desire in searching for the qualities of the Buddha, not laying aside that desire;reliance on, and freedom in the great religion of the Buddha and producing thoughts drawn away from limited religious ways;producing thoughts not narrowed down by meanness;the desire to give to those who ask, the giver’s triply purified delight in giving after having given;always feeling harmony with moral people, but being pleased to help the immoral, by one’s own purity of morality giving the consolation that the fear of any bad destiny can be transcended;transforming [one’s own morality by purifying it] into the morality of the Tathāgata;firmness [so as not to come into the power of bad moments of existence] and unbreakableness;thoughts which are not hostile, tolerance and gentleness towards others whose ways of speech are wicked and bad;absence of conceit;respect consisting in bowing to and revering teachers;always a smiling face and no sternness;readiness to speak;absence of hypocrisy, boasting or threatening;pure intention, no harshness in thought and no fraudulence;seeing what is praiseworthy in everything and reflecting on one’s own faults;not encouraging sin, but pursuing the delightful moments of existence;love for the bodhisattvas like love for the teacher [the Lord Buddha];love for religion like love for oneself;love for the Tathāgatas like love for one’s life;love for one’s masters like love for one’s father and mother;(p. 91) love for livings beings like love for one’s sons;love for one’s teachers and preceptors like love for the Buddha;love for spiritual progress like love for one’s head;love for the perfections like love for one’s hands and feet;love for preachers of religion like love for all kinds of riches;love for all the qualities of a Buddha like love for the jewel which grants all wishes;love for admonitions like love for all joy and pleasure;love for contentment like love for health;love for seeking religion like love for medicines;love for those who urge one on and make one mindful like love for a physician.
[To summarize:] Reverend Śāradvatīputra, this resilience of the faculties in all one’s faculties is said to be great joy.
Great joy has the form [or essence (svabhāva) ] of peace since it is the knowledge of understanding;the form of absolute peace since it is the absence of haughtiness;the form of tranquility since it is the absence of arrogance [which is not to have given up the vices (kleśa) ];the form of joy of the senses since it is not distracted [because of concentration (samādhi) ];the form of ascetic commitment since it is the absence of forgetfulness;the form of gentleness since it is wished for [by all, being pleasant];the form of listening since it is gentleness in speech;the form of calmness since it is fitness of thought;the form of contentment since it is action well done;the form of no regret since it is faultless [having done no sin];the form of being well established since it is immovable [by hostile forces, etc. (vipakṣâdi) ];the form of being immovable since it is not established in any particular place [among things (bhāva) and distinguishing marks (nimitta) ];the form of being hard to conquer since it is hard to subdue;the form of real meaning since it is never lost;the form of truth since it is never different from what it is;the form of reality since it effects just that;the form of effort since it is power;the form of power since it is uncrushable;the form of fulfilling the qualities of the Buddha through not getting tired of seeking the qualities of the Buddha in the right way.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the bodhisattvas’ imperishable great joy.
14th Imperishable: Equanimity. (p. 92)
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ equanimity is also imperishable.
The bodhisattvas’ equanimity is of three kinds. Which three kinds? 1) Equanimity with vices, 2) equanimity to protect oneself and others, and 3) equanimity with regard to the timely and the untimely.
1) What then is equanimity with vices?
No haughty thoughts when respected, no depressed thoughts when not respected;no conceitedness because of gain, no irritation at the lack of gain;no pleasure in fame, no dejection because of its absence;not getting disheartened when blamed,being established in the true state of things when praised;the power of reflecting on suffering, the power of discerning impermanence and suffering in pleasure;the same thoughts towards friend and enemy by giving up likes and dislikes;the same attitude towards the moral and the immoral;not being dualistic concerning things done well or badly;no regard for what is pleasant and unpleasant;tolerance of what is both well and badly attended;no predilection with regard to the well formulated and the badly formulated;considering the miseries of enjoyment in a balanced way;the same intention towards all beings;no regard for body or life;the same light on superior, average and inferior;the same thoughts towards the famous and the obscure;purity of thought confronted with both the true and the untrue.
Thus [to summarize], reverend Śāradvatīputra, no haughty thoughts when respected, no depressed thoughts in misfortune, there the bodhisattva is equanimous; this, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ equanimity with vices.
2) What then is equanimity to protect oneself and others?
Even if the limbs or extremities of the bodhisattva’s body are cut off, he is not enraged, and he does not seek [a way to avoid it], he is thus equanimous [protecting himself and others].
As for change in the body [as when hurt by the body of another], as for change in speech, it is enduring both, thus it is called equanimity.He is not hurt by the forms of the eye, nor hurt by the forms of the objects of the eyes, (p. 93) nor hurt by both [coming into their power];and similarly not by the ears or sound, nose or smell, tongue or taste, body or tangibles, he is not hurt by the forms of mind, nor hurt by the forms of moments of existence, thus it is called equanimity.He is not hurt, nor injured, thus it is called equanimity.When hurt [by others], he does not hurt [others as retaliation], thus it is called equanimity;arising in connection with oneself and others, thus it is called equanimity;it is the same practice in prosperity and adversity, thus it is called equanimity.
This is because equanimity is the absence of quarreling,equanimity is introspection concerning one’s own thoughts [that is, understanding that all moments of existence are mental (caitta), and thus not a consequence of outer things; or, not giving one’s thoughts up to the power of aversion (dveṣa) ],equanimity is protecting the thoughts of others,equanimity is considering oneself [as responsible in a conflict],equanimity is not hurting others [but considering conflicts as arising from one’s own actions],[and, to summarize,] equanimity is the state of concentration pertaining to the bodhisattva.
This is called the bodhisattva’s equanimity to protect oneself and others.
3) What then is equanimity with regard to the timely and the untimely?
The Awakened Lords do not say that equanimity should be practised in all situations.Why?
The bodhisattva should always make effort and exertion in seeking the good moments of existence for himself and others, and he should practise equanimity with regard to the timely and the untimely.
What then is equanimity with regard to the timely and the untimely?
Equanimity [or, no action] towards unfit and uninterested beings;equanimity towards loss, blame, ill repute and suffering;equanimity towards the beings who have reached certitude on the way of disciples;equanimity towards taking up morality [practising it or praising it] at the time of giving;equanimity towards taking up generosity at the time of morality;equanimity towards taking up vigour at the time of tolerance;equanimity towards taking up meditation at the time of vigour;equanimity towards taking up a wish of giving at the time of meditation;equanimity towards taking up the five perfections as an object at the time of insight.
This is equanimity with regard to the timely and the untimely.
Thus he does not do the things not to be done; this is called equanimity, when here and there he does not exert himself.
The absence of inactivity in regard to the moments of existence which are necessary [to reach awakening], not giving up vigour, power, confidence, strength and exertion, fulfilling all those good moments of existence,this, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable equanimity.
VII. Tools
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ five kinds of supernormal knowledge are also imperishable.What five?1) Divine sight, 2) divine hearing, 3) knowledge of others’ thoughts, 4) remembrance of former lives, and 5) knowledge of magical means.
15th Imperishable: Divine Sight.
What then is the bodhisattvas’ divine sight?
[1. Distinguished both as worldly and as unworldly (lokalokottaraviśiṣṭa):]As for the divine sight of all the gods, the divine sight of all snake-gods and all demons, the divine sight of all celestial musicians, giants, divine birds, man-horses, great serpents, men and not men, the divine sight of all disciples with their training completed or not, the divine sight of all the isolated buddhas, compared with all these the divine sight of the bodhisattvas perfecting omniscience and perfecting the exalted [practices] is better, higher, more eminent, more excellent, clearer, finer, stronger and more brilliant.
[2. Seeing all forms (sarvarūpadarśana):] By that divine sight, whatever manifestations of form occur in the endless and limitless worlds in the ten directions, be they coarse or subtle, superior or inferior, distant or near, all those are known, made manifest, penetrated, thoroughly known, thoroughly seen by that divine sight of theirs.
All beings in the endless, limitless worlds in the ten directions (p. 95) – excluding the formless beings – born in any state of existence, he knows as it is the death and birth of all of them, he knows as it is the causes of their actions, he knows as it is the fruits of their actions as well as the diversity of their abilities.
As for the splendour of qualities in the buddha-fields of the Awakened Lords in endless, limitless worlds in the ten directions, all of that he sees. Having seen it, he transforms by the purity of his own morality the accumulated multitudes of merit and knowledge into purification of the splendour of qualities in his own field. And the transformation performed by those established in the qualities of morality is thus accomplished.
By the divine sight of theirs he also sees all the congregations of bodhisattvas belonging to those Lords. Having seen them, he fulfils the penetration into skill in insight, knowledge and expedient means, as well as the skill in right action, behaviour, where to go, recollection, awareness, conduct, where to live, powers, religion, liberation [the extinction established nowhere (apratiṣṭhitanirvāṇa) ], knowledge, way of confidence, remembrance and eloquence of those good men.
[3. Not sullied by opposing impurities (pratikūlamalânupalipta, vipakṣânupalipta):] That sight of theirs is unhindered since it sees all forms;that sight of theirs is unattached since it is beyond cupidity;that sight of theirs is free from habits, viewpoints and the manifestations of vices;that sight of theirs is pure since it is originally luminous;that sight of theirs is not dependent on any field of perception;that sight of theirs is non-origination of habits and vices;that sight of theirs is free of blindness since it is beyond doubt;that sight of theirs does not arise among the obscuring moments of existence;that sight of theirs has attained clarity concerning the manifestations of all moments of existence;that sight of theirs relies on knowledge, not being within the range of consciousness;that sight of theirs is not impassioned, enraged or deluded by any vices;that sight of theirs is an aid to penetration into the abilities of the holy;that sight of theirs is unattached knowledge since it shines equally on all beings [that is, looking similarly on all with compassion (karuṇā) ];that sight of theirs is pure since it is freed from the bad moments of existence in thoughts;that sight of theirs is impeccable since it is essentially beyond impurity;that sight of theirs is created from the sight of the Buddhas since they never give up their intention [to reach omniscience];that sight of theirs is unattached and unborn since it is beyond aversion;that sight of theirs is produced by [having as the object] the truth pertaining to the sphere of [real] meaning, it is the unattached treading of the path of pure knowledge.
[4. The pure cause (viśuddhahetu):] Why [is the divine sight of those bodhisattvas as above explained]?Because those good men are established in great compassion,knowing the moments of existence,penetrating the meaning of things [namely their emptiness (śūnyatā) ],are faultless,they preach religion in accordance with what they have seen and heard,they are turned away from the bad,turned towards the place of awakening,their thoughts are not hindered in anything,they are generous to the stingy,having pity on the immoral,they are without violent thoughts towards the violent-minded,(p. 96) bringing vigour to the lazy,showing the methods of meditation to those who are not concentrated,giving the eye of insight to those with limited insight,showing the way to those on bad ways,making those of inferior conviction understand the exalted religion of the awakened,causing them to penetrate the knowledge [characterized by the absence of thought-constructions (nirvikalpalakṣaṇa) ] of the omniscient,they possess unhindered supernormal knowledge for the sake of fulfilling awakening.
This is called the bodhisattvas’ supernormal knowledge of divine sight.
(p. 97) 16th Imperishable: Divine Hearing.
What then is the bodhisattvas’ supernormal knowledge of divine hearing?
[1. Distinguished both as worldly and as unworldly (lokalokottaraviśiṣṭa):] As for the divine hearing of all the gods, the divine hearing of all snake-gods and all demons, all celestial musicians, giants, divine birds, man-horses, great serpents, men and not men, the divine hearing of all disciples with their training completed or not, the divine hearing of all the isolated buddhas, compared with all these the divine hearing of the bodhisattvas perfecting omniscience and perfecting the exalted [practices] is better, higher, more eminent, more excellent, clearer, finer, stronger, more brilliant.
[2. Having all words as the object (sarvaśabdâlambana):] By that divine hearing, the sounds of words in endless, limitless worlds in the ten directions, the words of gods, snake-gods, demons, celestial musicians, giants, divine birds, man-horses, great serpents, men and not men, the words of saints, the words of disciples, isolated buddhas, bodhisattvas and Complete Buddhas, all are recognized by that sense-organ of divine hearing, even the words of the inhabitants of hell, animals, the inhabitants of Yāma’s world, gadflies, flies, wasps and bees are heard.
[3. Knowledge of the causes (hetu) by which the words arise:] The objects of thought, good, bad or neutral, by which the vocal activity of those beings is brought about, he knows them all also truly as they are.
[4. Knowledge of the fruit (phala) which arises:] The vocal activity dependent on good causes, the vocal activity dependent on bad causes, and the vocal activity dependent on neutral causes, he knows them all also truly as they are.
[5. Knowledge of adverse causes and fruits (pratikūlahetuphalajñāna):] The vocal activity having its origin in the latent habit of greed which those filled with aversion perform,the vocal activity having its origin in the latent habit of greed which the deluded perform,the vocal activity having its origin in the latent habit of aversion which the greedy perform,the vocal activity having its origin in the latent habit of aversion which the deluded perform,the vocal activity having its origin in the latent habit of delusion which the greedy perform,the vocal activity having its origin in the latent habit of delusion which those filled with aversion perform,the vocal activity having its origin in the latent habit of greed which greedy perform,the vocal activity having its origin in the latent habit of aversion which those filled with aversion perform,the vocal activity having its origin in the latent habit of delusion which the deluded perform,he knows them all truly as they are.
The vocal activity with pure intention but limited practice,the vocal activity with pure practice but limited intention,the vocal activity with pure intention and pure practice,the vocal activity with impure intention and impure practice,all those he knows truly as they are with his unhindered supernormal knowledge of divine hearing.
[6. No vices on any side in duality (ubhayaniṣkleśa):] By the supernormal knowledge of divine hearing they hear the words of both the holy and the profane. Having heard them, they have no attachment to the words of the holy, no aversion towards the words of the profane, they attain great friendliness towards the words of the holy, (p. 98) they attain great compassion towards the words of the profane.
[7. Knowledge of the three times as not adulterated (trikālâsaṃsṛṣṭajñāna):] They know truly as it is the distribution of all words in the past and the future [the present is not mentioned in the sūtra, since that knowledge is evident].
[8. Its action (karman):] By that supernormal knowledge of divine hearing they hear all the words of the Buddhas. Having heard them, they retain them all by the state of recollection, awareness and no forgetfulness. Retaining them they do not forget and they also make living beings remember in accordance with their abilities, they also know the essential and unessential moments of existence truly as they are.
If they hear the teaching of one Tathāgata, they neither conceal nor elevate the teachings of a second Tathāgata, they grasp the words of all the Buddhas simultaneously.The good, bad or neutral words they hear they proclaim at proper times through recollection and awareness.But even if it is the time when there is a congregation of disciples, if they realize it is not the time for teaching, they give it up; even though they have heard [of religion], they do not teach.When it is time to teach religion because of one person, they do not teach to all even at the time when there is a congregation of disciples there.They do not give an explanation painful to others even if it is true; but with skill in means and purity of thoughts they may give an explanation though not true when it is helpful to others.The kinds of words they wish to be heard are heard, and the words they do not wish to be heard are not heard.They know truly as it is the knowledge pertaining to the organ of hearing of all beings in a congregation where religion is taught, and having known it, they teach religion with an essence according to that.And the beings they make religion known to, hear their teaching in religion; the beings they do not make religion known to, do not hear their teaching of religion.
[9. Its cause (hetu):] That sphere of hearing of theirs is the purified sphere of all moments of existence [or, arising from meditating thereon];that sphere of hearing of theirs is purified knowledge [having omniscience as the object];that sphere of hearing of theirs is purified of the sphere of self;that sphere of hearing of theirs is purified of the sphere of animated being, the sphere of life-principle, the sphere of personality;that sphere of hearing of theirs is the discernment of sounds, syllables and explanations as they are heard.They teach religion according to language to beings born in the five states of existence who have different words, syllables and explanations.
That sphere of divine hearing of theirs is transformed into the divine hearing of the Tathāgatas since it does not attend to any other way [such as that of the disciples or isolated buddhas].
This is the bodhisattvas’ imperishable supernormal knowledge of divine hearing.
17th Imperishable: Knowledge of Others’ Thoughts.(p. 99)
What then is the bodhisattvas’ imperishable supernormal knowledge of of the knowledge of other’ thoughts? Knowing the thoughts of others is 1) knowing the thoughts of all beings in the past, 2) knowing their future thoughts, and 3) knowing their present thoughts.
1) With knowledge of past thoughts he enters the thoughts of living beings having their causes in the past:(p. 100) “The thought of this being has a great cause, the thought of this being has an average cause, the thought of this being has a small cause. The abilities of this being are caused by [have the essence of, consist chiefly in] generosity, the abilities of this being are caused by morality, the abilities of this being are caused by tolerance, the abilities of this being are caused by vigour, the abilities of this being are caused by meditation, the abilities of this being are caused by insight, the abilities of this being are caused by friendliness, the abilities of this being are caused by compassion, the abilities of this being are caused by joy, the abilities of this being are caused by equanimity, the abilities of this being are caused by the way of disciples, the abilities of this being are caused by the way of isolated buddhas, the abilities of this being are caused by the great way.
This being is determined by the power of causes, but though he is connected with the stream of causes which are roots of good, this being may be born in a low family because of his practice.This being has pure intentions but impure practice, this being has pure practice but impure intentions, this being has pure intentions and pure practice, this being has impure intentions and impure practice.
Thus when he knows truly as they are all the kinds of knowledge of the mental behaviour of all beings from the abilities which have arisen from causes in the past, and, having known them, teaches religion accordingly to each, it is called knowing the past thoughts of others.
2) What then is knowing the future thoughts of others?
“The cause which is the present generosity of this being will be the cause of his morality in the future;the cause which is the present morality of this being will be the cause of his tolerance in the future;the cause which is the present tolerance of this being will be the cause of his vigour in the future;the cause which is the present vigour of this being will be the cause of his meditation in the future;the cause which is the present meditation of this being will be the cause of his insight in the future;the cause which is the present worldly knowledge of this being will be the cause of the unworldly in the future;the cause which is the present limited abilities of this being will be the cause of the great way for him in the future.
Thus the bodhisattva knows truly as they are the causes of beings, the conditions and the forms [of the consequences] as they will be in the future.He does not get tired of maturing living beings; he teaches religion to the extent of his knowledge of entering the thoughts [of others] and to the extent that [others] are worthy of religion.He teaches the fruitful religion and does not become envious of other religious discourses.(p. 101) This is called knowing the future thoughts of others.
3) What then is knowing the present thoughts of others?
The bodhisattva knows truly as they are the thoughts and mental events of all beings arising in the present.He knows the impassioned thought truly as it is, as an impassioned thought,he knows the thought without passion truly as it is, as a thought without passion,thus with the enraged and the one without rage,the deluded and non-deluded,the vicious and the non-vicious,the attentive and non-attentive,the concentrated and unconcentrated,the one sinking down and the active,the regretful and non-regretful,the peaceful and non-peaceful,the freed and non-freed,the expanded and narrow,the small, extensive and great,he knows the immeasurable thought truly as it is, as immeasurable.
Thus he knows truly as they are all the vices, whichever vices obscure the thought of this or that being, and having known them, he teaches religion by his knowledge so that there is an escape from the vices.And to whatever congregation he goes, first he sees the mind of that congregation, and having seen it, he teaches religion accordingly to each person separately.Thus he perceives the superior or inferior abilities of those beings, he knows all of them truly as they are.
One’s own thought is not obscured and others’ thought is not obscured.Why?Because the stream of thoughts of that bodhisattva knows by knowledge, knows by recollection, knows by intelligence, knows by understanding, knows by insight, knows by awakening.His stream of thought is without vices, pure through having completely cut off the vices and fetters which are impressions of past deeds, immaculate, shining, unblamable, not harsh, beyond vices, without impurities, it knows through the light of all moments of existence, and entering the mental behaviour of all beings it [the bodhisattva’s stream of thought] knows the stream of thought completely.Entering into the knowledge which is nearness of thought to such moments of existence is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable supernormal knowledge of knowing others’ thoughts.
18th Imperishable: Remembrance of Former Lives.(p. 102)
What then is the bodhisattvas’ supernormal knowledge which consists in realizing the knowledge of the remembrance of former lives?
[1. By what he remembers (yena smarati):] He remembers his former lives with that remembrance;that remembrance is sustained by [that is, born from as a cause (hetu), or has the same essence (svabhāva) as] the sphere of all moments of existence,it is steadfast through [correctly (aviparīta) ] making known [all moments of existence],not agitated since it is well prepared through knowledge,beyond harm since it is established in peaceful meditation,beyond deception through attaining expanded vision [that is, insight (prajñā) ],not dependent on any other because of immediate knowledge,to be remembered through having the quality of recollection and not forgetting,the accumulation of merit through knowing the great way,the accumulation of knowledge since it is not contingent on anything else [in thriply purified (trimaṇḍalapariśuddha) meditation (dhyāna) ],the accumulation of all the perfections through transcending everything.
[2. What he remembers (yat smarati):] He remembers his former lives with that remembrance, he remembers one birth, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, he remembers even a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, several hundred births, several thousand births, several hundred thousand births, a world-age of manifestation, a world-age of destruction, several world-ages of manifestation, several world-ages of destruction, he remembers even several world-ages of manifestation and destruction, a hundred world-ages, a thousand world-ages, a hundred thousand world-ages, several hundred world-ages, several thousand world-ages, he remembers even several hundred thousand world-ages:
[3. How he remembers (yathā smarati):] “Those beings there had such and such a name, there I also existed with such a name, in such a social class, in such a family, with such a complexion, eating such food, having such a long life, staying for so long a time, experiencing such pleasure and pain, dying there, being born yonder, dying there, being born here.”
Thus he remembers different former lives with their forms, characteristics and places. He remembers his own as well as (p. 103) other beings’ former lives from the beginning.
[4. The great purpose when he has remembered (smṛtvā mahârthikatā):] He remembers his own roots of good and the roots of good of other beings with their causes in the past, and having remembered his own roots of good he transforms them into awakening, having remembered the roots of good of other beings he inspires them to produce the thought of awakening.He relies on the impermanence, suffering, emptiness and egolessness in suffering caused by past formative factors.He does not, however, get conceited because of his reliance on impermanence, suffering, emptiness and selflessness, nor conceited by complexion, nor conceited by health, nor conceited by youth, nor conceited by his way of living, nor conceited by his pleasures, nor conceited by followers, nor conceited by lordliness,not seeking to be the king of the gods, nor seeking to be the lord of the world, nor seeking to be a protector of the world, nor seeking to be a universal king, nor wishing any kind of birth.He does not seek pleasures, kingship, lordship or power for his own pleasure, quite the opposite, he seeks birth in existence intentionally for the sake of maturing living beings.By reliance on impermanence, suffering, emptiness and selflessness he feels ashamed of his former impure actions, he rejects and despises them.In the present he does not do anything which ought not to be done even for the sake of his life, and he transforms and expands the former roots of good for the sake of awakening.He transforms the roots of good in the present for the sake of all beings collectively, he gives up transformation contrary to this [namely to be born as a disciple, an isolated buddha, a god or a man] and transforms them for the sake of the continuity of the lineage of the Buddhas, the lineage of religion and the lineage of the community, and for the sake of omniscience.
This is called the bodhisattvas’ supernormal knowledge which consists in realizing the knowledge of the remembrance of former lives.
19th Imperishable: Magic.(p. 104)
What then is the bodhisattvas’ supernormal knowledge consisting in knowledge of the way to magical power?
[1. Stemming from a pure cause (viśuddahetvutpanna):] It is the attainment, use and mastery of moments of existence that have been reached through [concentration (samādhi) consisting in] eagerness, vigour, thinking and consideration;then, by cultivating these bases of [or causes (hetu) creating] magical power, he consciously attains unconditioned magical power and experiences [or partakes (upabhuj-) without effort (anābhoga) in] different miracles effected by magical power.
[2. Teaching in different forms (vicitrâkāradesanā):] Those miracles of his effected by magical power mature beings extensively, having regard for living beings.Whatever miracles of magical power which beings are to be disciplined by, he displays them to the beings, either in form, power or magical transformation.He displays to living beings just that appearance of beauty and complexion by which living beings are to be disciplined, the appearance of beauty and complexion of a Buddha, the appearance of beauty and complexion of a bodhisattva, the appearance of beauty and complexion of an isolated buddha, the appearance of beauty and complexion of a disciple, the appearance of beauty and complexion of a king of gods, the appearance of beauty and complexion of a world-protector, the appearance of beauty and complexion of a universal king, in the same way, the appearance of beauty and complexion of Viṣṇu, Skanda, the Great Lord, Brahmā or Prajāpati, the appearance of beauty and complexion of those not being any one of these, he displays to living beings just that appearance of beauty and complexion, even that of animals, and he teaches religion to living beings according to their faith.
[3. Putting it into power (vaśitvakaraṇa):] He displays just that power by which beings with very arrogant, aggressive, conceited, haughty and furious powers are to be disciplined, be it the power of the king of gods, the power of the lord of the world, the power of a world-protector, the power of a universal king, the power of a great athlete, a quarter of Nārāyaṇa’s power, half the power of Nārāyaṇa, (p. 105) or the [full] power of Nārāyaṇa.Even though Meru, the king of mountains, is sixty-eight thousand yojanas high and eighty-four thousand yojanas in breadth, one with the power of a bodhisattva can toss it up with three fingers; the power of that bodhisattva is unimpeded, so that he could even throw it to another world-sphere as if it were a fruit of the Āmalaka.Having placed upon the palm of his hand this world-system of threefold thousand great thousand worlds, so great, so wide, from the element of water to beyond the border of Avīci, he remains thus for a world-age or more while displaying all the right ways of behaviour.The bodhisattva, having such power, teaches religion to beings with very arrogant, aggressive, conceited, haughty and furious power to discipline their arrogant, aggressive, conceited, haughty and furious power.
[4. Making one form enter any other form (sarvarūpapraveśana):] By those bases of magic he attains knowledge of magical occurrences, and whatever he brings about by different kinds of knowledge of magical occurrences, that happens. If he brings about a magical occurrence thinking: “Let the great ocean have the size of the hoofprint of a cow,” it remains the size of the hoofprint of a cow, and: “Let the hoofprint of a cow be the great ocean,” it remains the great ocean.
[5. Changing (anyathākaraṇa):] If he brings about a magical occurrence thinking: “Let the world-conflagration be a mass of water,” it remains a mass of water, if he brings about a magical occurrence thinking: “Let the mass of water be a mass of fire,” it remains a mass of fire, if he brings about a magical occurrence thinking: “Let the mass of fire be a mass of wind,” it remains a mass of wind, if he brings about a magical occurrence thinking: “Let the mass of wind be a mass of fire,” it remains a mass of fire, if he brings about a magical occurrence thinking: “Let the mass of fire be a mass of earth,” it remains a mass of earth, if he brings about a magical occurrence thinking: “Let the mass of earth be a mass of fire,” it remains a mass of fire, thus, whatever moments of existence, insignificant, average or great he brings about through magical presence, precisely these take place.
[6. Not overcome by the magical power of any other (pararddhyanabhibhūta):] No one at all, excepting the Awakened Lords, is able to disturb, agitate or make disappear that magical presence of his, be it the king of gods, the creator of the world, the Evil One, the followers of the Evil One, not anyone in the world, even though in accordance with religion; no being whatsoever is able to disturb, agitate or make disappear that magical presence of the bodhisattva.By producing power through knowledge of the bodhisattva’s magical presence he teaches religion to beings with the languages they are pleased and content with, finding most important, by way of entering into their words.
His bases of magic power are elevated far above [those of the seers (ṛṣi) and disciples, etc.],autonomous,beyond the range of all the Evil Ones and the vices,they are entrances into the region of the Buddhas [as by them one penetrates into the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātu) ],having no intention of harming any being,acquiring all the roots of good and the accumulations,they cannot be suppressed by the Evil One and his followers.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the the bodhisattvas’ imperishable supernormal knowledge consisting in knowledge of the way to magical power.
(p. 106) These, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ five imperishable kinds of supernormal knowledge.
VIII. The Power of Maturing
20th-23rd Imperishable: Means of Attraction.
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the four means of attraction are also imperishable. What four? 1) Generosity, 2) loving speech, 3) acting for the good, and 4) common aim [for oneself and others].
Generosity is giving material gifts and the gift of religion;loving speech is speaking gentle words lovingly to beggars and listeners to religion;(p. 107) acting for the good is intentionally fulfilling the good for oneself and others;common aim is when he establishes those receiving religion and material gifts on the way he himself conceives as having the highest qualities [namely the Mahāyāna, characterized by stages and perfections (bhūmipāramitālakṣaṇa) ].
Further, generosity is pleasing the thoughts of beggars;loving speech is not deriding beggars;acting for the good is fulfilling the aim of beggars;common aim is when he [the bodhisattva] introduces them to just that way.
Further, generosity is giving with intention;loving speech is unbrokenness of practice;acting for the good is having no regrets after giving with determination;common aim is transforming [them] into the great way.
Further, generosity is giving with thoughts associated with friendliness;loving speech is not giving up happy and joyful thoughts;acting for the good is exertion in any action of living beings accompanied by thoughts purified by great compassion;common aim is transforming into knowledge of omniscience with thoughts accompanied by equanimity and not concerned with high and low.
Further, generosity is giving away pleasures which are in accordance with religion;loving speech is establishing in religion those to whom one has given gifts;acting for the good is fulfilling one’s own and others’ good;common aim is engendering the thought of omniscience for the sake of all beings.
Further, generosity is giving away inner and outer things;loving speech is the absence of the secrecy of teachers concerning knowledge of the qualities of all moments of existence;acting for the good is giving up one’s own good and acting for others;common aim is no depression when giving away to others the pleasures acquired and held in the hands.
What then is the gift of religion?Teaching religion as handed down by tradition [from one’s teachers and preceptors (ācārôpādhyāya) ];loving speech is explanation of religion with thoughts which are not attached to material things [thinking of gain and profit];acting for the good is not being tired of instructing others [in meditation] and introducing them to the study [of books];common aim is attaining qualities [like powers and intrepidities] not separated from the thought of omniscience and introducing others [to the same].
Further, the gift of religion is unwearyingly and untiringly teaching religion to listeners of religion as they are coming;loving speech is explaining religion though having travelled a long distance;acting for the good is teaching religion by continuity of thought possessed by determination when giving all they are in need of to persons seeking religion and carrying a begging-bowl, without the necessities of life such as garments, food, places to sleep and sit and medicinal herbs, and to others too;common aim is introducing [beings] to incomparable, perfect awakening, transforming it into that when giving the gift of religion.
Further, the gift of religion is giving away the gift of religion knowing it is the foremost of all gifts [before giving things and giving safety, as it leads to liberation];(p. 108) loving speech is teaching religion for the sake of the good things [to obtain the happy states of existence of gods and human beings];acting for the good is teaching religion relying on the meaning [of emptiness (śūnyatā) ], not relying on the letter;common aim is teaching religion for the sake of fulfilling all the qualities of a Buddha.
Further, the gift of religion is the perfection of generosity;loving speech is the perfection of morality and the perfection of tolerance;acting for the good is the perfection of vigour;common aim is the perfection of meditation and the perfection of insight.
Further, the gift of religion belongs to the bodhisattvas who have produced the thought of awakening for the first time;loving speech belongs to the bodhisattvas who have entered their practice;acting for the good belongs to the bodhisattvas who are never to turn back;common aim belongs to the bodhisattvas who are hindered by only one birth.
Further, the gift of religion is the basis of awakening, its root and seed;loving speech is the burgeoning sprouts and leaves of awakening;acting for the good is the open flower of awakening;common aim is the resulting fruit of awakening.
These, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ four imperishable means of attraction.
IX. Attaining the Power of Teaching
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ four kinds of knowledge are also imperishable. Which four? 1) Knowledge of the meaning, 2) knowledge of moments of existence, 3) knowledge of interpretation and 4) knowledge of eloquence.
24th Imperishable: Knowledge of The Meaning.
What then is knowledge of the meaning [or the individual essential characteristics (pṛthaglakṣaṇa) ]?
Knowledge of the real meaning in all moments of existence,i. e., knowledge of the moments of existence [knowledge that the conditioned (saṃskṛta) things in the sphere of passion (kāmadhātu) have the essential characteristic (lakṣaṇa) and nature (dharmatā) of suffering (duḥkha) and impermanence (anityatā) ];reflective knowledge [knowing the essential characteristic of the causes (hetu) and conditions (pratyaya) in the origin (hetusamudaya) from which the suffering in the same sphere (dhātu) stems];successive knowledge [namely that of the above-mentioned characteristics in the spheres of

and conditions as they bring about fruit];knowledge of non-duality [of no extremes like eternity or cessation (śāśvatoccheda), or, that causes and conditions are non-existent in the highest meaning (paramârthatas) ];knowledge of not going to any extreme;knowledge of not remaining in the middle;[but still] knowledge of understanding the conditions [involved in dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda) ];knowledge of the homogeneity of the sphere of all moments of existence;knowledge in accordance with things as they are [namely in accordance with universal emptiness (śūnyatā)

marks;knowledge of not longing for anything, there being nothing to long for;knowledge of the absence of conditioning when confronted with the unconditioned;knowledge of penetrating the one principle [or the one essential characteristic (ekalakṣaṇa) of all moments of existence];knowledge understanding selflessness,knowledge understanding no being,knowledge understanding no life-principle,knowledge of the highest truth of no personality;knowledge not attached to the past;knowledge of the future as unsettled [having no end, being imperishable (akṣaya), or, unhindered knowledge of future events];knowledge of the present as wholly unblamable [since no aversion or attraction arises understanding the present things as without essence (niḥsvabhāva) ];knowledge of illusion when concerned with the parts of personality [as created by a magician (māyākāra) ];knowledge seeing the spheres of sense-perception as snake-poison [killing fast the roots of good (kuśalamūla) ];knowledge of introspection concerned with the fields of sense-perception as empty villages [without any beings (sattva), like the fields of sense-perception are without self or anything realated to a self (ātmātmīya) ];knowledge of inner peace;knowledge of no activity concerned with outer things;knowledge of the objects of perception as non-different from an illusion;knowledge of practising recollection;knowledge in accordance with tolerance [of both pain (duḥkhādhivāsanākṣānti) and the unborn state of things (anutpattikadharmakṣānti) ];knowledge reflecting with intelligence [the essence of insight (prajñāsvabhāva) ];knowledge of seeing [the essence (svabhāva) of] the self;knowledge of seeing when it concerns the truths;knowledge of non-origination when it concerns suffering;knowledge of the unconditioned when it concerns the origin [of suffering];knowledge of no distinguishing marks when it concerns cessation [of suffering];knowledge of liberating [from the ocean of existence (saṃsārasamudra) ] when it concerns the way [to cessation of suffering];knowledge of the divisions of words concerning the moments of existence [knowing how to explain their meaning (artha) ];knowledge of no recollection and no mental effort when it concerns the practice of recollection;knowledge understanding both the good and the bad [so as to increase the good and get rid of the bad] when it concerns correct exertions;knowledge of the swiftness of body and mind when concerned with the bases of magic [making body and thought useful (kāyacittakarmaṇyatā) ];knowledge attaining the abilities;knowledge of the uncrushable when concerned with the powers;knowledge seeing all moments of existence as they are when concerned with the limbs of awakening;knowledge of no going and no coming when concerned with the way;knowledge of remaining when concerned with peaceful meditation;knowledge of manifestation when concerned with expanded vision;knowledge of [deceptive] creations [of, e.g., elephants and men created by means of incantations (mantra) or drugs (auṣadha) ] when confronted with illusions;the knowledge of misunderstanding [air for water] when confronted with a mirage;knowledge of seeing irreality [of the moments of existence appearing] in a dream;knowledge of apprehending the condition [namely that it arises from another sound] for the echo;knowledge of the unchanging [on which the images are projected] when concerned with images;knowledge [as explained in the section on truth] of the one characteristic in what has different characteristics;knowledge of disintegration in combinations [that all composite things in the end disintegrate];knowledge of no connection [from the moments of existence in one birth to those in another birth, when viewed from the standpoint of the highest meaning (paramārtha) ] in connections;knowledge of understanding in accordance with the words of others [of teachers and preceptors (ācārôpādhyāya) ] when concerned with the way of disciples;knowledge understanding dependence [of phenomena on each other], knowledge of staying apart [in body] and one-pointedness [of thought] when concerned with the way of the isolated buddhas;(p. 110) knowledge of begetting accumulations of the roots of good when concerned with the great way.This is knowledge of the meaning.
Further about knowledge of the meaning: knowledge of the meaning is that by which one relies on all moments of existence through reliance on the meaning.Why?
All moments of existence are absolutely empty, and the meaning which is emptiness is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely without distinguishing marks, and the meaning which is being without distinguishing marks is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely beyond longing, and the meaning which is being beyond longing is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely unconditioned, and the meaning which is being unconditioned is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely beyond origination [in the future], and the meaning which is complete non-origination is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely unborn [in the past], and the meaning which is complete unbornness is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely inexistent [having no own nature (svabhāva) in the present], and the meaning which is complete inexistence is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely separate [since essentially being what they are (tathatāsvabhāvatvāt) ], and the meaning which is complete separatedness is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely without self, being, life-principle, personality, and the meaning which is no self, being, life-principle or personality is the meaning concerned.
Understanding moments of existence this way is knowledge of the meaning.
[To summarize:] The teaching concerning this is an unhindered teaching, unattached teaching, imperishable teaching, a teaching of attaining all moments of existence; that teaching of meaning is knowledge of the meaning.That knowledge of the meaning is imperishable in displaying all meaning,even the Lord Buddhas teach it and are pleased [when others teach it].[That is because] it is true, essentially no lie and no other than itself,it is the wholly unblamable understanding through insight and knowledge.
This is knowledge of the meaning.
25th Imperishable: Knowledge of the Moments of Existence.(p. 111)
What then is knowledge of the moments of existence?
It is knowledge of all [the following] moments of existence in accordance [with their meaning (artha), though they be expressed by words (nāman) ]:
The knowledge that what pertains to the good and the bad, the blamable and the blameless, the sullied and the unsullied, the conditioned and the unconditioned, the worldly and the transcendent, the perfect and the low, what has a part in the impure and the pure, existence and extinction, the knowledge that those [moments of existence] are the same as [and of one taste (ekarasa) in] the [empty] sphere of all moments of existence, the knowledge that those [moments of existence] are the same as awakening [not different from the unconstructed knowledge (nirvikalpajñāna) of penetrating the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātu) ], the knowledge that those are the same as the spheres of sense-perception [which, as described in section 10. f. 2, are the same as the sphere of all moments of existence], this is knowledge of the moments of existence.
Further, knowledge of the moments of existence is knowledge of thoughts as they arise and linger on in beings behaving according to desire,behaving according to artificial desire [as when coming in touch with others’ thoughts that produce desire, though originally not having much desire in oneself], behaving according to unartificial desire [having originally much desire],behaving according to desire which appears different from what it is [like apparent desire really being aversion, great desire seeming small or small desire seeming great],behaving according to desire for view-points,behaving according to excessive desire, behaving according to moderate desire, behaving according to slight desire, behaving according to desire which is not slight,behaving according to desire for conventions,behaving according to desire for practice, behaving according to desire for intention, behaving according to desire for determination,behaving according to desire for the essential characteristics [of moments of existence],behaving according to desire in opposition to the character [of desire, and thus not looking like desire],behaving according to desire establishing [in the world the twelvefold collection of scriptures],behaving according to desire because of conditions, behaving according to desire because of past conditions [having remembered the objects of desire in the past], behaving according to desire because of conditions in the future [wishing some particular form to appear in the future], behaving according to desire because of conditions in the present,beings with inner desire [for the taste of meditation (dhyānāsvāda) or mental desire which does not seem great outwardly], but no desire for outer things,beings with outer desire but no inner desire,beings with inner desire as well as desire for outer things,beings with no inner desire nor desire for outer things,beings with desire for forms, but no desire for sounds, tastes, smells or tangibles,beings with desire for sounds, but no desire for forms, tastes, smells or tangibles,beings with desire for smells, but no desire for forms, sounds, tastes or tangibles,beings with desire for tastes, but no desire for forms, sounds, smells or tangibles,beings with desire for tangibles but no desire for forms, sounds, smells or tastes,this is penetrating into living beings behaving according to desire.
Thus, in this way the [ways of] behaviour of living beings according to desire are twenty-one thousand, the [ways of] behaviour of living beings according to aversion are twenty-one thousand, the [ways of] behaviour of living beings according to delusion are twenty-one thousand, the [ways of] behaviour of living beings where the [three vices mentioneds] are present in equal amounts are twenty-one thousand.The knowledge of thoughts as they arise and linger on in beings behaving in eighty-four thousand ways,(p. 112) the knowledge of teaching religion accordingly to each individual [like teaching meditation on the unpleasant (aśubhabhāvanā) to the desirous (rāgin) ],the knowledge of not going beyond the proper time [in maturing and teaching],the knowledge of distinguishing between the recipients,the knowledge of teaching religion giving fruit,the knowledge of teaching the uninterrupted and unexcelled religion,that is knowledge of the moments of existence.
26th Imperishable: Knowledge of Interpretation.
What then is knowledge of interpretation?
Knowledge understanding the words of all beings,i. e., understanding the words of gods, the words of snake-gods, the words of demons, the words of celestial musicians, giants, divine birds, man-horses, great serpents, men and not men.In short, he knows all languages, sounds, voices, ways of speech, interpretations, conventional explanations and linguistic behaviour of living beings in the five states of existence, and having known them he teaches religion through his understanding of words to those beings with those words and interpretations.This is knowledge of interpretation.
Further concerning knowledge of interpretation:“These ways of practice should be seen thus,these moments of existence [of practice] should be brought about thus,these moments of existence should be connected with thus,these moments of existence should be understood thus,these moments of existence should be construed with syllables thus,”thus he knows the language of one person, knows the language of two persons, knows the language of many persons,knows the language of men, knows the language of women, knows the language of those with no sex,knows the language of past [beings], knows the language of future [beings], knows the language of present [beings],knows the meaning attributed to one syllable, knows the meaning attributed to many syllables, knows the meaning not attributed to anything.This is knowledge of interpretation.
Further, that knowledge of interpretation is the knowledge of moments of existence designated by language, in the cessation [or unbornness] of all moments of existence, (p. 113) this is knowledge of interpretation.
That knowledge of interpretation of his is unhindered;not erroneous;well arranged;without repetitions;not excessive [when it concerns sound, not harmful to the ear];not hasty;speech not deviating from right speech [and thus clear in words and syllables (padavyañjana) ],[thus fluent and] clear;embracing both meaning and letter;pleasing according to different congregations;having different kinds [of explanations of one moment of existence];profound;profound in appearance;adorned with both concealed truth and the highest meaning;penetrating [what things are truly like] by means of one’s own thoughts, [thus penetrating one’s] knowledge [of meaning and letters (arthavyañjana) ] and [the logical conclusions (siddhānta) of one’s] viewpoints;taught by the Buddhas,and pleasing living beings.
This is knowledge of interpretation.
27th Imperishable: Knowledge of Eloquence.
What then is knowledge of eloquence?
[1. What eloquence is (yat pratibhānam):] Knowledge of giving unattached instructions [when answering questions, not hesitating, teaching everything, not confined to a single subject],knowledge of giving unbroken instructions [even though asked many different questions from different people at the same time],knowledge of giving instructions unhindered [by any opponent (parapravādin) or depending on certain motivating causes (hetu) ],quick eloquence,ready eloquence,swift eloquence,unfailing eloquence [understanding reality (tattva), attaining extinction (nirvāṇa) ].
[2. Where eloquence is (yatra pratibhānam):] Eloquence in accordance with the questions,eloquence never diverted,eloquence never given up,eloquence with connection [between words and meaning],eloquence giving understanding,eloquence with joy in [and only concerned with] religion [giving up chattering (pralāpa) ],eloquence established in the power of tolerance [not answering harsh words with irritation and harsh words],profound eloquence [teaching emptiness],varied eloquence,eloquence concerned with both concealed truth and the highest meaning,eloquence concerned with generosity, morality, tolerance, vigour, meditation and insight,eloquence teaching the [twelvefold] divisions of words of all the teachings of the Buddha,eloquence concerned with the profound way, with presence of recollection, right exertion, the bases of magic, abilities, powers and the limbs of awakening,eloquence concerned with peaceful meditation and expanded vision,eloquence being knowledge of the moments of existence expressed by words, seeing the interpretations,eloquence being knowledge of penetrating meditations, liberations, concentrations, states of concentration and truths,eloquence concerned with all the religious ways,eloquence comforting all beings in their practice through true teaching.
[3. How eloquence is (yathā pratibhānam):] It is no unconcentrated or foolish speech,no harsh speech [so that words and syllables (padavyañjana) are not in accordance with the mind (manas), or, in showing the means (upāya) to bring back again those deviating from their practice (śikṣā) ],firm speech,no provocative speech [when teaching the means (upāya) to penetrate the highest truth (paramārtha), or, in saying that the penance (tapas) of the tīrthikas is not a meaningful way (anarthikamārga) ],mild speech,pure speech,completely free speech,unhindered speech,speech not deviating from right speech [in words and syllables (padavyañjana) ],gentle speech,unassailable speech,unconceited speech,peaceful speech,sympathetic speech,coherent speech,speech connected [when it concerns word and meaning, always explaining fully after giving an epitome],complete speech [since it increases and spreads all roots of good],logical speech [since it is in accordance with the three standards of knowledge (pramāṇa) ],unimpaired speech [through creating, increasing and spreading roots of good],pleasant speech [when it concerns meaning],delicate speech [when it concerns the syllables],irreproachable speech [not breaking one’s vows],speech beneficial [to all congregations],speech praised by the holy,(p. 114) speech in accordance with making endless buddha-fields understand [filling them with speech arising from that eloquence],speech in accordance with making [Brahman, here the same as extinction (nirvāṇa) ] understood, discerning Brahmā’s speech.With the eloquence taught by the Buddhas he teaches religion to other beings and other persons with knowledge of their abilities, superior or inferior as they may be.
That teaching of religion of his succeeds in effecting the real cessation of suffering for the one who practises it.
This is knowledge of eloquence.
These, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ four kinds of imperishable knowledge.
X. Knowledge of the Means to That
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ four reliances are also imperishable. What four? 1) Reliance on meaning, not reliance on the letter; 2) reliance on knowledge, not reliance on consciousness; 3) reliance on explicit scriptures, not reliance on implicit scriptures; 4) reliance on the true state of moments of existence, not reliance on the person.
28th Imperishable: Reliance on Meaning.
What then is the meaning, what is the letter?
The letter is teaching the entrance into the moments of existence and the actions of the world; while the [empty (śūnya) ] meaning is understanding the moments of existence transcending the world.
The letter is teaching generosity, self-control, vows and discipline; while the meaning is the knowledge that generosity, self-control, vows and discipline are the same [in being without own-being (niḥsvabhāva), or, the meaning is knowing the emptiness of those moments of existence (teṣāṃ dharmāṇāṃ śūnyatājñānam) ].
The letter is enumerating and proclaiming the imperfections of existence; while the meaning is understanding existence as being beyond comprehension.
The letter is proclaiming the qualities, the praise of extinction; while the meaning is (p. 115) the absence of thought-constructions concerning the moments of existence which are all originally extinguished.
The letter is teaching according to the differentiation of religious ways; while the meaning is knowledge of entering the non-differentiation and homogeneity of absolute reality.
The letter is teaching to give away all one’s belongings; while the meaning is knowledge of threefold purity [no own-being (niḥsvabhāva) in giver, given or recipient].
The letter is teaching to take upon oneself all the vows, morality, training, qualities of purity and austerities in body, speech and thought; while the meaning is knowledge of the purity in taking upon oneself all the vows, morality, training, qualities of purity and austerities without apprehending body, speech or thought.
The letter is teaching the power of tolerance and mildness to overpower all ill-will, harshness and anger, malice, conceitedness, pride and arrogance; while the meaning is the tolerance that all moments of existence are unborn.
The letter is to take vigour upon oneself to gather all the roots of good; while the meaning is [the fruit of vigour, namely] vigour not dependent on rejection and appropriation [of bad and good].
The letter is teaching meditation, liberation, concentration and states of concentration; while the meaning is the [fruit of those teachings, namely] knowledge of entering the state of cessation.
The letter is the root of the insight of all who retain learning; while the meaning is the knowledge of the ineffable meaning.
The letter is revealing the thirty-seven moments of existence which are like the wings of awakening; while the meaning is realizing the fruit of accomplishing the thirty-seven moments of existence which are like the wings of awakening.
The letter is revealing the truths of suffering, origination and the way; while the meaning is realizing cessation.
The letter is revealing that [twelvefold chain of dependent origination] which begins with ignorance and ends in ageing and death; while the meaning is that which begins with cessation of ignorance and ends with cessation of ageing and death.
The letter is teaching the accumulation of [pure morality, moderation in eating, avoiding crowds, staying awake in the beginning and end of the night, preparing for] peaceful meditation and expanded vision; while the meaning is knowledge of wisdom and liberation.
The letter is teachings for beings who act out of passion, aversion, delusion or the three together; while the meaning is the imperturbable knowledge which is liberated thought.
The letter is revealing the moments of existence which are hindrances or pertain to hindrances; while the meaning is the unhindered knowledge which is liberation.
The letter is displaying the endless praise of qualities in the three jewels; while meaning is seeing the body of the Buddha [including all] moments of existence, the state of moments of existence in cessation where all passion has disappeared, the knowledge of attaining the unconditioned qualities of the Buddha, his religion and congregation [that is, knowledge understanding the qualities of the Buddha, his religion and the congregation according to their essence in the highest meaning (paramārthasvabhāvâdhigamajñāna) ].
[To summarize:] The letter is displaying the mass of qualities in the bodhisattva from the time he first produces the thought of awakening until he sits on the place of awakening; while the meaning is the complete awakening to omniscience through insight appearing in a moment of thought.
In short, teaching the eighty-four thousand masses of religious teaching is the letter; while the meaning which cannot be uttered in the words, syllables (p. 116) and sounds [or letters] of all beings is the meaning.
This is reliance on meaning, not reliance on the letter.
29th Imperishable: Reliance on Knowledge.
What then is consciousness and what is knowledge?
Consciousness is the consciousness [involved with] four places.What four?The places of consciousness are the places where it is involved with form, involved with feeling, involved with perception, involved with formative factors, this is consciousness.What then is knowledge? Knowledge is the thorough knowledge of the part of personality which is consciousness as placed among the four other parts of personality.
Further concerning consciousness [that is, knowledge of the character of the four elements (caturmahābhūtalakṣaṇa), hard, wet, etc.], the consciousness of the element earth, the consciousness of the element water, the consciousness of the element fire, the consciousness of the element wind, this is consciousness; while knowledge that the consciousness resting on [having as the object (ālambana) ] the four kinds of elements is undifferentiated from the sphere of all moments of existence, is knowledge [since it is of one taste (ekarasa) in being essentially characterized by emptiness (śūnyatālakṣaṇa) in the highest meaning (paramārthatas) ].
Further concerning consciousness, the information in forms known by the eye [namely eye-consciousness (cakṣurvijñāna) ], and thus in sounds known by the ear, smells known by the nose, tastes known by the tongue, tangibles known by the body, the information in the moments of existence known by the mind, this is consciousness; while inner peace and no roaming about among outer objects, having no thought-construction [of inner things] nor any imagination [grasping for distinguishing marks (nimittagraha) ] concerning any moments of existence through reliance on knowledge, this is knowledge.
Further, the origination of consciousness from an object [from the object-condition (ālambanapratyaya) ], the origination of consciousness from mental activity, the origination of consciousness from fancies, this is consciousness; while no grasping [at a self], (p. 117) no clinging [to anything of mine], no apprehension [of any own-being (svabhāva) in any form (rūpa) ], no information [that there is consciousness and a subject apprehending it], no thought-construction [concerned with self or moments of existence], this is knowledge.
Further, consciousness arises within the range of the conditioned, there is no activity of consciousness in the unconditioned; knowledge of the unconditioned is knowledge.
Further [to summarize], consciousness depends on origination and destruction; knowledge depends on no origination and no cessation.
This is reliance on knowledge and not reliance on consciousness.
30th Imperishable: Reliance on Explicit Scriptures.
What then are explicit scriptures, what are implicit scriptures?
The scriptures which are taught to enter the way are called implicit; while the scriptures which are taught to enter the fruit are called explicit.
The scriptures which are taught demonstrating concealed truth are called implicit; while the scriptures which are taught demonstrating the highest truth are called explicit.
The scriptures which are taught to enter into action and duties are called implicit; while the scriptures which are taught for the sake of cessation of action and vices are called explicit.
The scriptures which are taught to explain impurities are called implicit; while the scriptures which are taught for the sake of purification are called explicit.
The scriptures which are taught as producing disgust for existence are called implicit; while the scriptures which are taught to enter non-duality of extinction and existence are called explicit.
The scriptures which are taught with various words and syllables are called implicit; while the scriptures which are taught as deep, hard to see through and hard to understand are called explicit.
The scriptures with many words and syllables taught to please the thoughts of living beings are called implicit; while the scriptures with few words and syllables taught to produce mental introspection in living beings are called explicit.
The scriptures proclaiming with various words self, being, life-principle, life-sustaining principle, spirit, personality, human being, man, acting subject, feeling subject, teaching there is a ruler where there is no ruler are called implicit; (p. 118) while the scriptures teaching emptiness, absence of distinguishing marks, that there is nothing to long for, the unconditioned, unborn, unoriginated, inexistent, selfless, beingless, soulless, personless, spiritless, absence of a ruler and the gates of liberation are called explicit.
This is called reliance on explicit scriptures, not reliance on implicit scriptures.
31st Imperishable: Reliance on the True State of Moments of Existence.
What then is the true state of moments of existence, what is the person?
When established in the view that the person exists and undertaking several kinds of religious practice [like generosity (dāna) and morality (śīla) to be liberated], [one] is [concerned with] the person; thorough knowledge of what it is to undertake things related to the view that the person exists [that is, undertaking generosity (dāna) and morality (śīla) having understood that the person or the moments of existence undertaken for the sake of a person (pudgalârtham) are inexistent (abhāva) ] is the true state of moments of existence.
Further, the ordinary person,the good ordinary person,the person following his faith,the person following religious teachings,the person on the eighth stage,the person having entered the stream,the person returning once [to the sphere of passion],the person not returning,the person being a saint,the person being an isolated buddha,the person being a bodhisattva,the unique person born in the world for the sake of many beings’ benefit, many beings’ happiness, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit and happiness of great throngs of gods and human beings, as a teacher of gods and human beings, the Awakened Lord, the unique person born in the world,these are called persons.All those words for persons are taught by the Tathāgata from the standpoint of conventional phrases to guide beings.Those, however, who are attached to these [words] are [really] without anything to rely on.To bring them to reliance also the Lord says: “One should rely on the true state of moments of existence, not on a person”.
What then is the true state of moments of existence?
Changelessness,no imputation [of existence (bhāva) on the empty (śūnya) suchness (tathatā) ],no activity,no purification,having no basis [in moments of existence like form (rupa), etc.],being established nowhere [in the senses (indriya) like the eye, etc.],having no root,being the same everywhere [like empty space (ākāśa) penetrating all],the same as that which is the same [namely all moments of existence which have one essential characteristic (ekalakṣaṇa) ],the same as the unequalled [body of all moments of existence (dharmakāya) ],the same as that which is the same [having one essential characteristic (ekalakṣaṇa) ] and the unequalled [body of all moments of existence],no thought-constructions,no undertakings,certitude among all moments of existence [seeing that they are all characterized by being originally extinguished (prakṛtinirvṛtalakṣaṇa) ],having the essential characteristic of essence like endless space.(p. 119) This is called the true state of moments of existence.
There, those who rely on [and understand as emptiness (śūnyatā) ] the true state of moments of existence do not rely on [that is, grasp for as existing (bhāva) ] any sphere [of sense-perception].
Therefore all moments of existence are the true state of moments of existence through reliance on all moments of existence by means of this way of entering the gate of religion.
This is reliance on the true state of moments of existence, not reliance on the person.
Those, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable four kinds of reliance.
XI. The Path of Accumulation
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ accumulations of merit and knowledge are also imperishable.
32nd Imperishable: Accumulation of Merit.
What then is the bodhisattvas’ imperishable accumulation of merit?
The item of meritorious action consisting in generosity;the item of meritorious action consisting in morality and [the item of meritorious action consisting in] meditational self-cultivation;the state of concentration on friendly thoughts;the practice of great compassion;undertaking all good;confessing one’s own sins and making others do the same;the item of meritorious action caused by joy in the merit accumulated in the three times by all those to be trained and those who have completed their training, the isolated buddhas and the bodhisattvas who have produced the thought of awakening for the first time, those never to turn back and those hindered by only one birth;the item of meritorious action caused by joy in the production of the thought of awakening in all those to be trained and those who have completed their training, the isolated buddhas and the bodhisattvas who have produced the thought of awakening for the first time, those never to turn back and those hindered by only one birth;the item of meritorious action caused by joy in all the roots of good of all the Awakened Lords in the past, future and present;the item of meritorious action caused by prayers for the gift of religion, prayers for prolonging the life of all Buddhas [so that they will not enter extinction (nirvāṇa), but turn the wheel of religion], all bodhisattvas, all holy persons, both those to be

in the body [claiming to have qualities one does not have] through having constrained the body with vows;no hypocrisy with a basis in speech through having constrained speech with vows;no hypocrisy with a basis in mind through having constrained the mind with vows;attaining merit like Brahmā [and thus getting born in his heaven after death, attaining merit to attain extinction (nirvāṇa) ] by erecting shrines dedicated to the Tathāgatas;fulfilling the characteristics of a great man through endless offerings;fulfilling the marks of beauty by piling up the accumulation of various roots of good;adorning the body with the absence of conceit [because of being great or because of being small, etc.];adorning speech with the elimination of the imperfections of speech;adorning thought with the absence of violent thought towards any being;turning into an adornment of the buddha-field because of miracles through supernormal knowledge;turning into an adornment of religion through a state of no cupidity;turning into an adornment of the congregation through the absence of slanderous, harsh or wicked speech;becoming the acceptance of religion through having no envy for what is taught;[the merit that stems from the utterances of] giving compliments, rejoicing because of the unfailing teaching of religion;getting rid of the [five] hindrances through understanding the well-spoken words [of the Tathāgatas];listening to religious teachings after honouring them since they are the religious teachings that lead one out of the world;turning into an adornment of the tree

all];emitting the splendour of light by not despising the untrained;purity of birth by accumulating the merit of morality;purity of womb [being born spontaneously (upapāduka) ] by not blaming sins [but curing one’s own and others’ sins according to religion];birth among gods and men by purification through the ten ways of good actions;unfailing courage because of the absence of thought-constructions concerning the teaching;power over all moments of existence by no teachers’ secrecy concerning any moment of existence;power over all the world by true intentions;purity of one’s own buddhafield by purifying beings;purity of determination through relying on the maturation of actions [knowing that any good and bad that arise come from the maturation of one’s own action, so that one has pure determination in showing friendliness (maitrī) and no ill-will towards others];confidence in the exalted religion of the Buddhas through having no wish for limited practices [like those of the disciples and isolated buddhas which are practised only for the sake of oneself];embracing all merit through never giving up the thought of omniscience;fulfilment of the seven riches through being impelled by faith;embracing the religion of the Buddhas through having no regard for body or life;not breaking one’s word in any world by fulfilling one’s earlier promises [that is, one’s thought of awakening intending to liberate all beings to complete awakening];fulfilling the teachings of a Buddha by fulfilling all the good moments of existence.Thus he accumulates the causes by which all the qualities of the Buddhas are fulfilled.This, in short, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is what is known as the bodhisattvas’ imperishable accumulation of merit, which would take a world-age or more to expound in full.
(p. 122) 33rd Imperishable: Accumulation of Knowledge.
What then is the bodhisattvas’ imperishable accumulation of knowledge?The bodhisattva accumulates the causes and conditions by which he reaches knowledge [beyond duality (advayajñāna) ].Which causes, which conditions?
[The causes (hetu) are:] Deep eagerness in seeking knowledge [by eagerness and exertion in writing out and reading books, etc. (pustakalekhāpāṭhādicchanda’udyoga) ];always serving, living with and attending spiritual friends who have attained knowledge.He relies on the knowledge of the Buddha, not on the knowledge of the disciples and the isolated buddhas.It is absence of conceit towards and love for those spiritual friends like love for the masters, like love for the Teacher himself.The spiritual friends, having ascertained that the listener has good intentions [that he will not seek religion desiring gain and honour (lābhasatkāra), but will seek knowledge beyond duality (advayajñāna) ], bring about conversation [teaching (1) the moments of existence to be taught (deśyadharmadeśanā), the twelvefold Word (dvadaśâṅgapravacana) ] and speech concerned with knowledge [giving (2) teachings on the moments of existence to be accomplished (sādhyadharmadeśanā), explaining the causes (hetu), emptiness (śūnyatā) and so on, teachings which bring about knowledge beyond duality (advayajñāna) ],knowing he is a worthy recipient they unceasingly teach religion which is not concerned with outer things [like the manuals of the outsiders (bāhyakaśāstravyākaraṇa), but giving (3) teachings on the moments of existence to be attained (anugantavyadharmadeśanā), thus always teaching the moments of existence which are the wings of awakening (bodhipakṣyadharma) ].
[The conditions (pratyaya) are:] Having heard these religious teachings [of the above-mentioned three kinds, being causes (hetu), from spiritual friends] he [the person seeking religion] makes an effort to accumulate religious teachings, and the effort to accumulate religious teachings is his accumulation of knowledge.What then is the effort to accumulate religious teachings?
[1. Undertakings being causes of knowledge (hetvārambha):] Having few things for the benefit of oneself;doing few [worldly] things [like commerce and agriculture];being moderate in speech;having few necessities of life;making an effort at practising vigilance in the beginning and end of the night;reflecting on the meaning of what one has heard;seeking it more and more;no confusion in thought;suppression of hindrances;knowing the way out of the sinful;no remorse;no manifestation of vices;firmness in realization [not being content with the words only, but striving to accomplish the religious teachings as they have been heard];inclination towards religion [in grasping the words (vākya) of the teaching explained at the time of hearing (śrutakāla) ];proneness to religion [finding the meaning in the teachings heard (śrutadharmârtha) at the time of pondering (cintākāla) ];propensity to religion [in approaching the fruit (phala) by repeated meditation (bhāvanā) on the meaning found by pondering (cintā) ],perfection in courage [not being overcome by the contraries of vices, etc. (kleśâdivipakṣa) ];being like one whose head and clothes are on fire in seeking knowledge;but not attached to any of these [things in the way of not apprehending (anupalambha) them, not being attached to material things (āmiṣa) ];no loose morality;never putting the burden down;gaining distinction [in growing];avoiding crowds;finding joy in solitude;having the mind bent on solitude in the woods;content with the family of the holy;never unstable with regard to the qualities of purification;joy consisting in pleasure in the joy of religion;forgetting worldly incantations;seeking the supramundane moments of existence;unwavering recollection;being in accordance with understanding the meaning [in thinking in accordance with the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātu) ];being in accordance with the way through intelligence;keeping vows with steadfastness;accordance with knowledge by conditions [that is, knowledge in accordance with the principle of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda), or, accumulating the causes of knowledge beyond duality (advayajñānahetu) by knowing the essential character of the moments of existence which is dependent origination (dharmāṇāṃ pratītyasamutpādalakṣaṇajñānena) ];being adorned with shame and modesty [and thus doing no sin through having regard for oneself and others].[2. Undertakings concerned with the essence of knowledge (svabhāvârambha):] Making it the most important thing to be in accordance with knowledge [seeking it in any practice whatsoever];suppressing ignorance;purification of the eye of insight for those tied down by the darkness and blindness of ignorance and delusion;purity in understanding [no hindrances concerning things to be known or vices];broadness in understanding [having the Great Way in scope (mahāyānâlambanatayā) ];no narrowness in understanding [siding with the small way (hīnayāna) ];no divided understanding [no attachment to various kinds of viewpoints (dṛṣṭi) ];illuminated understanding [because of original purity (prakṛtiviśuddhi) ];immediate knowledge [unhindered in the three times].
[3. Undertakings which are fruits of knowledge (phalārambha):] Not to depend on the qualities of others [but obtaining good qualities oneself],no haughtiness because of one’s own qualities [having really obtained them];and praising the qualities of others [having no envy (īrṣyā) ] (p. 123);doing good actions;never freeing oneself from the burden of maturing one’s actions [even though understanding the state of emptiness (śūnyatādharma), he accepts the maturation of actions];knowledge of the purification of actions. [These are the conditions (pratyaya) ].
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable accumulation of knowledge.
Further, the accumulation of knowledge is of four kinds [that is, the causes producing knowledge (jñānotpādahetu) are of four kinds]. What four?
These four gifts augment the accumulation of knowledge. What four?The gift of birch-bark for writing, ink and books to the preachers of religion;different kinds of teaching thrones to the preachers of religion;giving all gain, honour and praise to the preachers of religion;giving compliments without guile to the preachers of religion to grasp religion [oneself].Those four gifts augment the accumulation of knowledge.
These four kinds of protection augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?Protecting the preachers of religion like protecting a lord [or protecting them for fear of kings (rājabhaya) ];protecting [their] roots of good;protecting [the preachers of religion when they travel in] kingdoms and among peoples;protecting the beneficial things.Those four augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.
These four kinds of support augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?Supporting the preachers of religion with material things;supporting them because of religion [to prolong the existence of true religion (saddharmacirasthitikatā) ];supporting them because of insight [so that their insight is not lost];supporting them because of knowledge [so that their knowledge grows and is not lost].Those four augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.
These five powers augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What five?The power of faith for confidence;the power of vigour for seeking learning;the power of recollection so as not to forget the thought of awakening;the power of concentration to have thoughts always reflecting on universal sameness;the power of insight for the sake of power of learning [so as to understand the teachings (dharma) ].Those five powers augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.
These four kinds of morality augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?The morality of joy in religion;the morality of seeking religion [through spiritual friends, listening to their teachings, writing and reading them];the morality of reflecting on religion [with logic (yukti) ];the morality of transforming into awakening.Those four kinds of morality augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.
These four kinds of tolerance augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?Tolerating bad speech [which enumerates bad qualities (doṣa) behind one’s back (parokṣāt) ] and abusive speech [uttered to one’s face (sākṣāt) ] through striving to seek religion;tolerating wind, sun, cold, heat, thirst and hunger through striving to seek religion;tolerance in accordance with teachers and preceptors [enduring pain to act according to their instructions] through striving to seek religion;tolerance of moments of existence as being emptiness, beyond distinguishing marks and beyond longing, through striving to seek religion.Those four kinds of tolerance augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.
(p. 124) These four kinds of vigour augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?The vigour to hear [many books (grantha) ];the vigour to retain in mind [their meaning (artha) ];the vigour to teach [others the teachings one has heard and grasped];the vigour to progress spiritually [cultivating by meditation the teachings].Those four kinds of vigour augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.
These four limbs of meditation augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?Staying [bodily] in solitude;one-pointedness [of thought];seeking supernormal knowledge in meditation;relying on the Buddhas’ knowledge [not that of disciples and isolated buddhas].Those four limbs of meditation augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.
These four lights of insight augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?Not behaving according to the view of annihilation;not entering into the view of eternity;not being in contradiction with dependent origination;tolerating absence of a self [without fear].Those four lights of insight augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.
These four kinds of expedient means augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?Accordance with the world;accordance with religion;accordance with living beings;accordance with knowledge [of omniscience].Those four kinds of expedient means augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.
These four ways augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?The way of the perfections;the way of the stages;the way of the wings of awakening;the way to knowledge of omniscience.Those four ways augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.
These four kinds of never having enough augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?Never having enough of learning;never having enough of teaching;never having enough of examining things;never having enough of knowledge.Those four kinds of never having enough augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.
Further, the accumulation of knowledge is to be in accordance with all living beings [not forsaking existence (saṃsāra) so as to work the weal of living beings (sattvārtha) with the form of great compassion (mahākaruṇārūpeṇa) ], but also to be in accordance with all religious things [even though in this way not forsaking existence (saṃsāra), not being in opposition to extinction (nirvāṇa), not forgetting extinction, in short, teaching the extinction which is found nowhere (apratiṣṭhitanirvāṇa) ].
The accumulation of knowledge should be seen as arising from generosity, and in the same way the accumulation of knowledge should be seen also as arising from morality, tolerance, vigour, meditation and insight;the accumulation of knowledge should be seen as arising from friendliness, compassion, joy and equanimity.
Why [do the above-mentioned things (dharma) become the accumulation of knowledge]?All the bodhisattvas’ undertakings [mentioned supra by name (nāmagrāhika) p. 122,18-123,4 and divided into 1) undertakings which are causes of knowledge (hetvārambha), 2) undertakings concerned with the essence of knowledge (svabhāvârambha) and 3) undertakings which are fruits of knowledge (phalārambha) ] originate through knowledge because they are preceded by knowledge [making knowledge the most important (jñānapara) ], because they rely on knowledge, and depend on knowledge of omniscience [by way of having it as the object (ālambana) ].It [the accumulation of knowledge] is the support of all who know,in it none of the Evil Ones will find a weak spot,here all the worthy receptacles of the Buddhas’ religion are present, and they attain the blessing of the Buddhas, they attain omniscience [being furnished with the causes (hetu) that bring omniscience about].
This is the imperishability of knowledge’s accumulation.(p. 125) These, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable accumulation of merit and knowledge.
XII. The Path of Practice.(p. 126)
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ four kinds of meditation by the presence of recollection are also imperishable.
Which four?
1) The presence of recollection which consists in the consideration of the body;2) the presence of recollection which consists in the consideration of feelings;3) the presence of recollection which consists in the consideration of thought;4) the presence of recollection which consists in the consideration of moments of existence.
34th Imperishable: The Presence of Recollection Concerned with the Body.
As for the bodhisattva’s presence of recollection which consists in the consideration of the body, how does the bodhisattva continually consider the body?
Continually [in concentration (samādhi) always having as the object the moments of existence (dharma) which have been examined by insight (prajñā) ] he considers [with insight (prajñā) examining the individual and general characteristics (svasāmānyalakṣaṇa) of] his own body and the body of others, he observes the past of the body, he observes the future of the body, he observes the present state of the body:
“Oh, this body originates from misunderstanding, is produced by causes and conditions, without a subject feeling or acting, without a ruling principle, beyond appropriation, arising by causes and conditons.Just as grass, bushes, plants and forests in the outside world arise by causes and conditions, without a subject feeling or acting, without a ruling principle, and beyond appropriation, in the same way this body is similar to grass, bushes, plants, forests, trees and walls, made up of the parts of personality and the spheres and fields of sense-perception, without a subject feeling or acting, beyond appropriation, empty of such moments of existence as a self, what pertains to a self, a permanent, stable, eternal, immovable, unoppressed or unchangable [substance].Even though there is no activity of a self in this body, I will wake up completely to the core by means of this body without a core.What is that core? The body of the Tathāgatas.I will attain that body of the Tathāgatas, the body of [all] moments of existence, the adamantine body, the uncrushable body, the firm body, the body distinct from the threefold world.Even though there are many imperfections in my body, I am going to attain the body of the Tathāgatas which is without imperfection.”
He gives up his body, an accumulation of the four elements, through the power of observation, as he sees the benefit in this:“This body of mine may perish for any matter whatsoever of any being.Just as the four outer elements, the element of earth, the element of water, the element of fire and the element of wind, provide beings with various kinds of pleasure in various ways, by various forms, in various manners, by various objects, various necessities and various enjoyments, in the same way I will make this body, which is an accumulation of the four elements, (p. 127) turn fully into something for the enjoyment of living beings in various ways, by various forms, in various manners, by various objects, various necessities and various enjoyments.Having this motive he observes bodily suffering, but he does not get exhausted by bodily suffering since he has regard for living beings;he observes the impermanence of the body, but he does not get exhausted by birth and death;he observes selflessness in the body, but he does not get exhausted by bringing beings to maturity.He observes that the body is peaceful, but he does not fall into the apathy of peacefulness;he observes that the body is empty, beyond distinguishing marks, not something that can be longed for, something apart [having the essence of extinction (nirvāṇasvabhāva) ], but he does not fall into the extreme of emptiness, absence of distinguishing marks, that there is nothing that can be longed for, something apart.”Thus he observes the body as unconditioned, non-originated, non-being, non-existent, as it is and pure, but he does not fall into the extreme of unconditionedness, non-origination, non-being or non-existence, thusness or purity;he observes the body as without a subject who feels [the pleasant and unpleasant fruits of good and bad action], without a [lord (īśvara) who is the] creator [of the body], without a master [that is, an inner spirit (puruṣa) ], beyond appropriation [by a self different from these having power (adhiṣṭhāna) over the body], as not different [from the real nature of the body (kāyadharmatā) ], as of one taste [namely that of emptiness (śūnyatā) ], having the essence of empty space [which is not material (avastuka) and all-pervasive (sarvagata) ], and as originally totally extinguished, but he does not fall into [that is, he does not realize (na sākṣātkaroti) ] the extreme of the body’s immovability, absence of a creator, absence of a master, not being owned, non-difference, being of one taste, having the essence of empty space or being originally totally extinguished.
Continually considering his body he does not see any substance or core;continually considering the body internally [that is, the body belonging to the continuity (saṃtāna) which is oneself] he provides no scope for inner vices;continually considering the body outwardly [that is, the body belonging to the continuity (saṃtāna) which is another being] he does not stay with outer vices.He gets a body without vices and then acts in a pure way, acting in a pure way he attains among gods and human beings a body adorned with the characteristics of a great man, he becomes beloved of gods and human beings because of his body which is adorned with the characteristics of a great man.
Thus the bodhisattva continually considers his body.
This is called the bodhisattvas’ presence of recollection which consists in the consideration of the body.
35th Imperishable: Presence of Recollection Concerned with Feelings.(p. 128)
Then concerning the bodhisattva’s presence of recollection which consists in the consideration of the feelings, how does the bodhisattva continually consider the feelings?
In these matters the bodhisattva thinks: “Any feeling whatsoever is suffering,” and by penetrating the feelings thoroughly, penetrating them with knowledge, penetrating them with insight, penetrating them through appeasement he experiences a pleasant feeling, but he does not cling to the proclivity of cupidity.When affected by a painful feeling, he produces great compassion for beings born in the places of woe, in unfortunate states of existence, and he does not cling to the proclivity of aversion.When affected by a feeling which is neither painful nor pleasant he experiences the feeling which is neither painful nor pleasant, but he does not cling to the proclivity of ignorance.He experiences any feeling whatsoever, pleasant, painful or neither painful nor pleasant, through recollection accompanying the feelings, and he cultivates the vision of knowledge concerned with being freed from all those feelings.
He puts on spiritual armour to know fully what all beings feel:“These beings do not truly know the way out of feelings [which is the knowledge that they are all empty], and because of ignorance of the way out they become attached when affected by a pleasant feeling, they feel aversion when affected by a painful feeling, and are deluded when affected by a feeling which is neither painful nor pleasant.With feeling joined to insight and knowledge I will teach religion so as to do away with the feelings of those beings, through skill in means destroying all feelings, through accumulation of the roots of good attained by great compassion.”
Further, why is it called feeling?(p. 129) Feeling which is not understood [as inexistent (abhāva) ] becomes [the cause (hetu) of] suffering, feeling which is understood through knowledge [as empty (śūnya) ] becomes [the cause of unsullied (anāsrava) ] pleasure.What then is the state of pleasure that pertains to the feeling which is understood through knowledge?Here there is no self, animated being, life-principle, soul, life-sustaining principle, spirit, personality, human or man whatsoever by which the feeling arises;feeling is attachment,feeling is appropriation,feeling is grasping,feeling is apprehension,feeling is misunderstanding,feeling is thought-constructions,feeling is clinging to a viewpoint,feeling is notions of [the existence (bhāva) of] the eye [being the cause (hetu) of feelings concerned with the concept of the eye],and in the same way feeling is notions of the ear, nose, tongue, body and mind,feeling is notions of forms,feeling is notions of sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles and moments of existence.The pleasure, pain or state of neither pain nor pleasure that arise from the condition of contact between eye and form is feeling,thus feeling is the pleasant, painful or neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise from the condition of contact between ear and sound, from the condition of contact between nose and smell, from the condition of contact between tongue and taste, from the condition of contact between body and tangibles, or from the condition of contact between mind and moments of existence.
Further, by way of enumeration, feeling is one, namely the experience of thoughts;feelings are two, namely inner and outer;feelings are three, namely past experience, future experience and present experience;feelings are four, namely the experience of the four elements;feelings are five, namely the mental effort in the five parts of personality;feelings are six, namely the imaginings in the six fields of sense-perception;feelings are seven, namely the seven states of consciousness;feelings are eight, namely the eight kinds of wrong practice;feelings are nine, namely the nine places of living beings;feelings are ten, namely [the suffering (duḥkha) arising as fruit from the causes (hetu) which are] the ten ways of bad action.
This is feeling in all its aspects;and, to the degree that there is perception, to such a degree there is mental effort,to the degree that there is mental effort, to such a degree there is fiction,to the degree that there is fiction, to such a degree there is feeling.That is why the feelings of immeasurable numbers of beings are immeasurable [and imperishable (akṣaya) ].
There the bodhisattva continually considering [by concentration (samādhi) and insight (prajñā) ] the feelings, produces knowledge of the feelings of all beings as they arise, remain and disappear.
[To summarize:] Knowledge of the feelings, the good and bad feelings of all beings as they arise, remain and disappear is called the presence of recollection which consists in the consideration of the feelings.
36th Imperishable: The Presence of Recollection Concerned with Thought.(p. 130)
What then is the bodhisattva’s presence of recollection which consists in the consideration of thoughtIt is not forgetting the thought of awakening, guarding it with recollection, and no lack of concentration.
He looks at [the] thought [of awakening] this way:“Thought [that is, thought itself and the thought of awakening] never remains once it has arisen, it is broken up and melts away as unstable, it does not remain internally, it does not perish outwardly, it is not perceived in between the two.The first thought of awakening arisen in me has perished and ceased, vanished and disappeared, it is not found in any place, not in any location, it is not possible to communicate it.And the thoughts by which the roots of good are accumulated for the sake of awakening, these have also perished and ceased, vanished and disappeared, they are not found in any place, not in any location, it is not possible to communicate them.The thoughts by which roots of the good are transformed into awakening are also of that nature, having those characteristics.Thought is not known by thought, thought is not seen by thought, [past] thought does not [perish in the future, it does not] connect itself to [future] thought.
What then is thought?That by which one thinks: ‘I will wake up to the incomparable perfect awakening’.But the thought of awakening does not stay with the roots of good [since there is really (svabhāvatas) no attainment at all]; and again, [thus] the thought of the roots of the good does not stay with the thought of transformation.Thus he reflects.
If the bodhisattva reflecting thus does not get afraid, scared or terrified, he is one to continually consider thought.
Again he thinks:“[Thought is essentially empty (svabhāvaśūnya), but] dependent origination is very deep since there is no destruction of [the connection between] the cause [that which is performed] and the fruit [attained, i. e., according to conventional truth (saṃvṛtyā) ].Even though the true state of thought is such [that it is in the highest meaning (paramārthatas) essentially empty (svabhāvaśūnya) ], all moments of existence are dependent on causes and conditions, but without a mover, without an activator, without an owner, beyond appropriation.I will create them [the causes (hetu), like giving up all belongings, and the fruit (phala), purifying my buddha-field] according to my wish, and I will exert myself in creating [according to conventional truth (saṃvṛtyā) ], but I will not give up the true state of thought [which is unborn according to the highest truth (paramārthatas) ].
(p. 131) What then is the true state of thought, what is creating?
Thought is like an illusion – here there is no giver at all – this is called the true state of thought,but when one gives up all belongings and transforms it so as to purify one’s buddha-field, it is called creating.
Thought is like a dream, characterized by absolute peace, this is called the true state of thought,but when one transforms morality, training and qualities of purification into omniscience – gathering the accumulation for awakening – it is called creating.
Thought is like a reflection, from the beginning not developed, this is called the true state of thought,but when one transforms all tolerance and mildness into attaining the tolerance that all moments of existence are unborn, it is called creating.
Thought is like a mirage [empty of water], dissociated [from and empty of subject and object (grāhyagrāhaka) ] because of its absolute dissociation, this is called the true state of thought,but when one transforms the undertakings of vigour for [attaining] all roots of the good into fulfilling all teachings of the Buddha, it is called creating.
Thought is without form, it cannot be demonstrated, is unhindered [and all-pervasive (sarvatragata) like empty space (ākāśa) ] and beyond communication, this is called the true state of thought,but when one transforms all meditations, liberations, concentrations and the states of concentration into attaining the concentration of a Buddha [that is, the concentration beyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpasamādhi) ], it is called creating.
Thought cannot be grasped; signless, it cannot be demonstrated, it has no basis, this is called the true state of thought,but when one transforms the knowledge of explaining by analysis all words of questions into fulfilling the knowledge of a Buddha, it is called creating.
Thought does not originate without an object [that is, without the causes and conditions of objects (ālambanahetupratyaya) ], this is called the true state of thought;when one produces thoughts that have all roots of good as the object for the sake of attaining all the qualities of a Buddha, it is called creating.
Thought does not originate without a cause, this is called the true state of thought,but when one produces thoughts for the sake of [that is, being the cause of] all the moments of existence that are wings of awakening, it is called creating.
Thought does not originate without the six object-fields of sense-perception, this is called the true state of thought,but when one produces thoughts [namely the moments of existence of insight and expedient means (prajñopāyadharma) ] for the sake of [that is, being the cause of, in that they produce] the field of all the teachings [and qualities] of a Buddha [this field, however, being emptiness (śūnyatā) ], it is called creating.
The bodhisattva continually considering thought treats [and thus makes one-pointed (ekāgra) ] thought so as to attain supernormal knowledge;and having attained supernormal knowledge by means of thought he knows the mental behaviour of all beings.Having known this he teaches them religion in accordance with their nature.The bodhisattva continually considering thought treats thought so as to attain great compassion; and having attained great compassion by means of thought he never gets tired of maturing all beings.The bodhisattva continually considering thought does not produce the thought that thought should perish, or that thought should cease [like the disciples and isolated buddhas intent solely on peace (śānti), on extinction (nirvāṇa); on the contrary, by expedient means (upāya) he does not cut off the roots of good (kuśalamūla) in the stream of existence (saṃsārasrotas) ],(p. 132) but he produces the thought to join himself to the roots of good in the stream of existence.Though he by that knowledge of recollection of thought is situated in the moment of existence which is the entrance into the certainty that all is unborn, does not arise and does not cease, he does not fall into the stage of disciples and isolated buddhas.And until the fulfilment of all qualities of a Buddha [that is, the incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi) for oneself and all other beings], he relates at any time to the continuity of thoughts [never giving up the continuity of thoughts which is the union of insight and expedient means (prajñôpâyayuganaddha) ];and he wakes up to incomparable, perfect awakening by insight associated with that moment.
This is called the bodhisattvas’ presence of recollection which consists in the consideration of thought.
37th Imperishable: The Presence of Recollection Concerned with Moments of Existence.(p. 133)
What then is the bodhisattva’s presence of recollection [being one-pointedness (ekāgratā) through concentration (samādhi) ] which consists in considering [and discerning with insight (prajñā) the emptiness of conditioned (saṃskṛta) and unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), sullied (sāsrava) and unsullied (anāsrava) ] moments of existence?
He sees [the emptiness of essence (śūnyatāsvabhāva), as described below, in] the moments of existence with the sacred sight of insight [which has the essential character of the absence of thought-constructions (nirvikalpalakṣaṇa) ] and does not get bewildered in the meantime until he sits on the place of awakening.
The bodhisattva continually considering the moments of existence does not see any moment of existence, however small, escaping emptiness, escaping the absence of distinguishing marks, escaping the fact that there is nothing to long for, escaping unconditionedness, escaping unbornness, escaping non-existence, escaping the absence of substance [according to the highest truth (paramārthatas) ], and, [according to the concealed truth (saṃvṛtitas) ] the bodhisattva continually considering the moments of existence does not see any moment of existence, however small, escaping dependent origination.
The bodhisattva continually considering the moments of existence sees things according to the truth, not according to untruth.
What then is truth [the moment of existence]?
The meaning of no self, the meaning of no living being, the meaning of no life-principle, the meaning of no personality, the meaning of no discontinuity, the meaning of no eternity, the meaning of no being, the meaning of no absence of being, this is called truth [the moment of existence].
What then is untruth [not a moment of existence]?
The view of self, the view of living being, the view of soul, the view of person, the view of discontinuity, the view of eternity, the view of being, the view of absence of being. This is called untruth [not a moment of existence].
Thus all moments of existence are true, all moments of existence are untrue.Why?Through reflection on all moments of existence as being emptiness, beyond distinguishing marks and nothing to long for, all moments of existence are true,but through attachment resulting in views of me and mine, all moments of existence are not true.
In this way the bodhisattva continually considering the moments of existence does not see any moment of existence at all which is not the qualities of the Buddha, not awakening, not the way, not liberation, which is not the way out [of the threefold world (traidhātuka) ].Knowing that every moment of existence is a way out he attains the gate into the concentration of great compassion for all beings called “Unhindered”.He gets the notion that all moments of existence, all vices, are artificial [the knowledge (jñāna) that they are illusory (māyopama) and without own-being (niḥsvabhāva) ]:“These moments of existence are beyond vices, they are not connected with vices.”Why?They [the bodhisattvas, or the moments of existence] are united to explicit meaning [the meaning of emptiness (śūnyārtha) ],so there is no accumulation of vices, no heaping up, no state of cupidity, no state of aversion, no state of delusion.Understanding those vices is awakening, and the essence of vices is the essence of awakening.Though he thus practises recollection, he does not practise anything, start upon or establish anything.
He knows the true state of things as remaining [forever unchanged through being empty], that is why the sphere of [all] moments of existence is called a state.(p. 134) The place where the sphere of [all] moments of existence is situated, there also the sphere of living beings is situated;the place where the sphere of living beings is situated, there also the sphere of empty space is situated.That is why all moments of existence are like empty space.
The bodhisattva continually considering moments of existence unites with the qualities of a Buddha, and though relying on all moments of existence, he relies on the qualities of a Buddha.Though he produces the knowledge that things perish, he does not make the conditioned things perish.He produces knowledge of non-origination,and though he produces viewpoints in living beings [for their benefit by concealed truth (saṃvṛtyā) ], he does not give up the side of non-origination.
[To summarize:] The presence of recollection concerned with moments of existence is when he is continually engaged in that recollection of all moments of existence.As many as are the moments of existence and designations of moments of existence that pertain to disciples, isolated buddhas, bodhisattvas and Complete Buddhas, he is continually engaged in that recollection of all of them [that is, understanding their emptiness].
[The meaning of recollection (smṛtyartha):] By that recollection he does not forget or lose them even until the end of time,continually engaged in that complete recollection of all moments of existence, by that recollection he does not forget or lose anything even until the end of time.The presence of recollection which consists in the consideration of moments of existence is a word designating the immeasurable,a word for universality, for uniting with all the qualities of the Buddha, for pleasing all beings, for vanquishing all the Evil Ones, and for reaching self-existent knowledge [beyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpajñāna) ].
This is called the bodhisattva’s presence of recollection which consists in the consideration of moments of existence.
These, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ four imperishable cultivations of the presence of recollection.
38th-41st Imperishable: Four Correct Eliminations.(p. 135)
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ four correct eliminations are also imperishable. What four?
1) He produces eagerness, strives, acts with vigour, controls his thoughts and exerts himself correctly so that sinful and bad moments of existence which have not yet arisen should not arise.
2) He produces eagerness, strives, acts with vigour, controls his thoughts and exerts himself correctly so that sinful and bad moments of existence which have arisen should be eliminated.
3) He produces eagerness, strives, acts with vigour, controls his thoughts and exerts himself correctly so that good moments of existence which have not yet arisen may arise.
4) He produces eagerness, strives, acts with vigour, controls his thoughts and exerts himself correctly so that good moments of existence should remain, be cultivated, increase, not be lost or forgotten, so that they should be fulfilled.
1) “He produces eagerness so that sinful and bad moments of existence which have not yet arisen should not arise” is an expression for thorough mental effort.“He strives, acts with vigour” is an expression for not giving up thorough mental effort.“He controls his thoughts and exerts himself correctly” is an expression for thorough reflection.
Why? Thorough practice is the non-practice of sinful and bad moments of existence.
What then are the sinful and bad moments of existence? The adversary of morality, the adversary of concentration and the adversary of insight.
What then is the adversary of morality? It is the corruption of morality, and anything else that may corrupt morality, that function as the adversary of the lot of morality. This is called the adversary of morality.
What then is the adversary of concentration? It is the corruption of practice [that is, the corruption of concentration (samādhivipannatā) ], and anything else that may distract thought, that function as the adversary of the lot of concentration. This is called the adversary of concentration.
What then is the adversary of insight? It is the corruption of views, and anything else that may corrupt views, manifestations of vices, obstructions and hindrances (p. 136) that function as the adversary of the lot of insight. This is called the adversary of insight.
These are called the sinful and bad moments of existence.
The thorough mental effort that provides no scope for the origination of such sinful and bad moments of existence is called the first correct elimination.
2) Again, when it is said “He produces eagerness, strives, acts with vigour, controls his thoughts and exerts himself correctly so that sinful and bad moments of existence which have arisen should be eliminated,” that is an expression for thorough mental effort.
Why? There is no heaping up in thought of those sinful and bad moments of existence [as they perish as soon as they have arisen, and thus] they are not found in any [inner or outer] place or location, it is not possible to communicate them [with words and symbols].
Concerning the knowledge of eliminating [or exerting oneself in connection with] those sinful and bad moments of existence which are [only] activity of thought [that is, they arise from thought]:the causes [superficial mental effort (ayoniśomanasikāra), the habits of vices (klesavāsanā) ] and [the outer object-spheres (viṣaya), namely] the objects [generating vices (kleśa) ] by which covetousness arises for a beautiful form, aversion to a repulsive form, or delusion with regard to a form of ignorance, by thorough mental effort confronting the impure in connection with these [objects] he allays covetousness, by friendliness he allays aversion, and by understanding dependent origination he allays delusion;the allaying of these vices is called elimination.
Having thus grasped the conventional truth [allaying cupidity with the impure, etc.], then by way of the highest truth he does not apprehend any moment of existence to eliminate, as he is conscious [by sacred knowledge (āryajñāna) ] of the sameness of all moments of existence [and that there is no duality between something to eliminate and someone eliminating, finding himself situated in the sameness of emptiness (śūnyatā) ]. That is why it is called correct elimination..
This is called the second correct elimination.
3) Again, when it is said: “He produces eagerness, strives, acts with vigour, controls his thoughts and exerts himself correctly so that good moments of existence which have not yet arisen may arise” that is an expression denoting the immeasurable.
Why? The moments of existence that the bodhisattva should accumulate are immeasurable.Here, eagerness is the root of all good moments of existence,vigour is the accumulation of all good moments of existence,and by inspiring thought he acquires all the good moments of existence.He reflects on those good moments of existence and discerns them.
This is called the third correct elimination.
4) Again, when it is said: “He produces eagerness, strives, acts with vigour, controls his thoughts and exerts himself correctly so that good moments of existence which have arisen should remain, be cultivated, increase, not be lost or forgotten, so that they should be fulfilled,” that is an expression for the roots of good that have been transformed into awakening.
Why? There is no destruction in the interim of a root of good that has been transformed into awakening until the end point which is the place of awakening.(p. 137) Why? Because that root of good is not dependent on the threefold world [not producing births therein].The root of good that is dependent on the threefold world perishes [after its matured fruit has been experienced (vipākaphalam anubhūya) ], but the root of good that is not dependent on the threefold world, having been transformed into omniscience, does not perish at all in the interim until the end point which is the place of awakening.
This is called the bodhisattva’s fourth correct elimination.
Those, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ four imperishable correct eliminations.
42nd-45th Imperishable: The Four Bases of Magical Power.(p. 138)
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ four bases of magical power are also imperishable.
What four? [Classification (prabheda):] 1) eagerness, 2) vigour, 3) thought, and 4) examination.
[Their cause (hetu):] The basis and place of their root is the four immeasurables of friendliness, compassion, equanimity and joy.By practising [for the first time], cultivating [again and again by meditation] and increasing [not interrupting meditation so as to perfect] these immeasurables he attains fitness of thought [that is, being able to stay concentrated (cittaîkāgryasthitibhavya) ].
[Their foundation (āśraya):] Attaining fitness of thought he reaches the first state of meditation, and thus he reaches the second, thus the third and thus the fourth [depending on (āśritya) the states of meditation mentioned he produces magical power (ṛddhi) ].By attaining these states of meditation he attains lightness of body and thought [that is, swiftness and the absence of sloth in action].
[Attaining their fruit (phalâbhinirhāra):] With lightness of body and thought he brings about the way into supernormal knowledge [that is, the supernormal knowledge of magical power (ṛddhyabhijñā) ].With the way into supernormal knowledge he produces magical power by eagerness, vigour, thought or examination.
Eagerness is to be concerned with those moments of existence [the concentration of eagerness (chandaḥsamādhi) or the qualities of a buddha (buddhadharma) ];vigour is to acquire those moments of existence [the immeasurables (apramāṇa), meditation (dhyāna) and magical power (ṛddhi) ];thought is reflecting [or concentrating] on the moments of existence [mentioned, if they are there or not];examining is skill [being insight (prajñā) ] with [the characteristics (lakṣaṇa) of] those moments of existence.
He accomplishes [magical powers (ṛddhi) ] by bringing about the bases of magical power, and that is why they are called bases of magical power.Here he creates [magical powers] by eagerness, fulfils them by vigour, arranges them with thought and discerns them with examining.
The bases of the bodhisattvas’ magical power stem from confidence and are unconditioned [being spontaneously attained (anābhoga) ],they constitute lordship and the ability to go where one pleases since it is a matter of producing one’s own thoughts [not dependent on other causes and conditions (aparahetupratyayâpekṣa) like the practice of concentration (samādhisamādhāna), etc., when acting],they are the proper accomplishment of all preparations,complete establishment in the roots [of faith (śraddhā), etc., or in the immeasurables (apramāṇa) of friendliness (maitrī), etc.],moving about anywhere [to any buddha-land (buddhakṣetra), being present everywhere (samantagata) ],being unhindered like the wind,having the same bounds as empty space.
Those, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ four imperishable bases of magical power.
46th-50th Imperishable: The Five Abilities.(p. 139)
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ five abilities are also imperishable.
What are the five abilities? 1) The ability of faith, 2) the ability of vigour, 3) the ability of recollection, 4) the ability of concentration and 5) the ability of insight.
1) What then is the ability of faith?The faith by which he has faith in four moments of existence.
Which four?a) He has faith in the right view concerning things in the world, things belonging to existence; he relies on the ripening of action: “Whatever action I do, good or bad, I will experience the ripening of that action.” Even for the sake of his life he does not commit a bad action.
b) He has faith in the bodhisattva’s practice, and entering that practice he has no wish for any other way of religious development.
c) According to the highest meaning, the explicit meaning, he has faith in all moments of existence as being characterized by reflection on the profound dependent origination, no self, no being, no life-principle, no life-sustaining principle, no personality, as characterized by emptiness, no distinguishing marks and the fact that there is nothing to long for, but he does not cling to any viewpoint.
d) He has faith in all the qualities of a Buddha, his powers, modes of fearlessness and so on, and having faith his doubt and hesitation disappear and he accumulates those qualities of a Buddha.
This is called the ability of faith.
2) What then is the ability of vigour?
The moments of existence he has faith in by the ability of faith, those moments of existence he accumulates by the ability of vigour, this is called the ability of vigour.
3) What then is the ability of recollection?
The moments of existence he accumulates by the ability of vigour, those moments of existence he does not forget by the ability of recollection, this is called the ability of recollection.
4) What then is the ability of concentration?
The moments of existence he does not forget by the ability of recollection, those moments of existence he makes the object of one-pointedness by the ability of concentration; this is called the ability of concentration.
5) What then is the ability of insight?
The moments of existence he makes the object of one-pointedness by the ability of concentration, (p. 140) those moments of existence he reflects on [the individual characteristics (svalakṣaṇa) ] and understands [the general characteristics (sāmanyalakṣaṇa) ] by the ability of insight; having knowledge of those moments of existence not dependent on [the teachings of] others, knowledge [realizing those moments of existence] in oneself, is called the ability of insight.
Thus these five abilities are helpers and associates, they fulfil the qualities of a Buddha, they reach the stage of prediction.Just as, reverend Śāradvatīputra, those who possess supernormal power in connection with the abilities of sense-perception do not give any prediction as long as the male and female organs of the foetus in the womb are not developed, just so the Awakened Lords do not predict the incomparable, perfect awakening as long as the bodhisattvas are not furnished with these five abilities transcending the world.
These, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are the bodhisattvas’ five imperishable abilities.
51st-55th Imperishable: The Five Powers.
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ five powers are also imperishable.
What then are the five powers? 1) The power of faith, 2) the power of vigour, 3) the power of recollection, 4) the power of concentration and 5) the power of insight.
1) What then is the power of faith?
It is confidence, faith and uncrushability.Even though the sinful Evil One approaches him in the form of a Buddha and deters him and dissuades him from one kind of confidence or another in reflecting on moments of existence, he is not able to move or disturb him or make the bodhisattva confident in faith turn away from the power of faith.
This is called the power of faith.
2) What then is the power of vigour?
Whatever application of vigour the bodhisattva embarks upon, whatever good moments of existence he practises, in all of them (p. 141) he attains firmness in producing power.The whole world with the gods is not able to move, disturb or deflect the bodhisattva connected with such production of power as long as he does not get out of that state [himself, having completed what should be obtained].
This is called the power of vigour.
3) What then is the power of recollection?
In whatever state of recollection of moments of existence he establishes his thought, no vice is able to deter him from that;by his producing the power of recollection all vices are defeated;that recollection of the bodhisattva cannot be crushed by any vice.
This is called the power of recollection.
4) What then is the power of concentration?
It is to behave in such a way that one depends on aloofness from all crowds [and thus stays concentrated, but even staying with the crowd, he stays concentrated]:He teaches by means of words and sentences, but even the thorns of words do not produce any hindrance to his first state of meditation;he practises inspection and examination of the good, but this is no hindrance to his second state of meditation;he produces joy and happiness, but this is no hindrance to his third state of meditation;he is not equanimous when it concerns maturing beings and helping true religion, but this is no hindrance to his fourth state of meditation.The moments of existence which are contraries to meditation are unable to get the better of him when he practises the four states of meditation.
He does not give up the state of concentration, but he is not born again through the power of concentration [in the sphere of forms (rūpadhātu) only, he is also reborn in lower states of existence through the power of his vows (praṇidhānavaśena) and according to his intention (saṃcintya) to help living beings].
This is called the power of concentration.
5) What then is the power of insight?
It is indomitable knowledge of worldly and unworldly teachings.Throughout his different births all crafts and professions, different kinds of knowledge, formulas and powers appear to him though he has no teacher; whatever is best in the world, be it hard to do, hard to endure or hard to obtain, that appears to the bodhisattva.And further, the unworldly moments of existence by means of which transcendence of the world is brought about, those also he understands by his production of the power of insight and knowledge.That which is uncrushable by gods, humans and giants, this is called the power of insight.
Those, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ five imperishable powers.
XIII. The Path of Vision.(p. 142)
56th-62nd Imperishable: The Seven Limbs of Awakening.
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ seven limbs of awakening are also imperishable.
What then are the seven limbs of awakening?
1) The limb of awakening of recollection, 2) the limb of awakening of discerning moments of existence, 3) the limb of awakening of vigour, 4) the limb of awakening of joy, 5) the limb of awakening of calming, 6) the limb of awakening of concentration, 7) the limb of awakening of equanimity.
1) What then is the limb of awakening of recollection?
The recollection by which he penetrates moments of existence, reflecting on moments of existence [understanding the complete reality (dharmadhātu) ], examining moments of existence [understanding the way (mārga) to complete reality (dharmadhātu) ], having a general view of moments of existence [understanding the books (grantha) describing that way (mārga) ], pondering on [the meaning (artha) of the] moments of existence, and understanding moments of existence [by repeated meditation (bhāvanā) ], by that recollection he penetrates the essential characteristic of moments of existence.
What then is the essential characteristic of moments of existence?All moments of existence are empty of essential characteristics.
That by means of which there is such recollection and understanding is called the limb of awakening of recollection.
2) What then is the limb of awakening of discerning moments of existence?
Knowledge of discerning the eighty-four thousand multitudes of moments of existence.He discerns as they should be discerned the moments of existence, the explicit in meaning as explicit in meaning, the implicit in meaning as implicit in meaning, concealed meaning as concealed meaning, the highest truth as the highest truth, the conventions as conventions, the decided as decided.
This is called the limb of awakening of discerning moments of existence.
3) What then is the limb of awakening of vigour?
Effort in order to attain exertion, endurance, power, courage, never turning back, eagerness, strength, never putting down the burden, [effort to attain] understanding of the way, [all these things being] concerned with this recollection, this discerning of moments of existence, joy, calming, concentration and equanimity.This is called the limb of awakening of vigour.
4) What then is the limb of awakening of joy?(p. 143) The joy of religion, the serenity of religion, and the delight in religion by which there is no depression in thought but rather faith and eagerness, the joy of religion by which there is the allaying and destruction of vices in body and thought.
This is called the limb of awakening of joy.
5) What then is the limb of awakening of calming?
By calming the body, calming the thoughts, pacifying vices there are no hindrances, and thoughts are stopped so as to enter peaceful meditation which is the object of this.
This is called the limb of awakening of calming.
6) What then is the limb of awakening of concentration?
The concentrated [i. e., one-pointed in emptiness (śūnyatā) ] thought by which he wakes up to knowledge of the moments of existence, not the unconcentrated [and discursive (saprapañca) ] thought;the concentrated thought by which he wakes up to those moments of existence [i. e., understanding their emptiness (śūnyatā) ], not the unconcentrated thought.He does not wake up by way of having done away with view-points and the potentialities and manifestations [of vices],but he wakes up to the sameness of all moments of existence [in that they are empty] through the sameness and homogeneity of all moments of existence.
This is called the limb of awakening of concentration.
7) What then is the limb of awakening of equanimity?
It is having thoughts which are not overwhelmed by moments of existence that have any part in pleasure and depression;not being carried away by worldly things and thus not being disturbed since not being [i. e., not having thoughts] dependent on the high and low [on success or misfortune];having no [feeling of] violence [even though hurt];not being carried away [getting into the power of contrary factors (vipakṣa) ];having no likes or dislikes,but being in accordance with the way of the sacred truths.
This is the limb of awakening of equanimity.
Those, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ seven imperishable limbs of awakening.
XIV. The Path of Cultivation.(p. 144)
63rd-70th Imperishable: The Holy Eightfold Way.
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ way is also imperishable.
What then is the bodhisattvas’ way?
The way is the holy eightfold way:1) right view, 2) right will, 3) right speech, 4) right action, 5) right livelihood, 6) right effort, 7) right recollection, and 8) right concentration.
1) What then is right view?
The holy one transcending the world,[being the unsullied knowledge beyond duality (anāsravâdvayajñāna), which is a view] not originated from the view of a self,nor that of a being, nor of a soul, nor of a person, nor of a spirit, nor of a personality, nor of a man, nor of a human being, nor of an acting subject, nor originated from the view of a feeling subject;not originated from the view of eternity or discontinuity;not originated from the view of being or non-being;not originated from the view of [seeing the distinguishing marks (nimittadarśana) in] good, bad or neutral [actions (karma) and their consequences (karmaphala), though having the view that they exist],as it is not originated from the view of existence or extinction;this is called right view.
2) What then is right will?
The will by which the vices of cupidity, aversion and delusion originate, those kinds of will he does not bring about;the will by which morality, concentration, insight, liberation, and the vision of the knowledge of liberation originate, those kinds of will he brings about;this is called right will.
3) What then is right speech?
The speech by which one does not torment oneself, nor others [with regret (kaukṛtya) ];does not infect oneself with vices, nor others;does not hurt oneself, nor others;the speech by which one enters the holy way rightly;being furnished with that concentrated and coherent speech,this is called right speech.
4) What then is right action?
As for bad action, he does not perform that action having bad fruit;as for good action, he performs that action having good fruit;as for mixed action, he does not perform that action having mixed fruit;as for action which is neither bad nor good, he performs that action having no fruit, (p. 145) being the end of action through action.With belief in [the fact that] actions [have fruits, even though realizing the unsullied sphere (anāsravadhātu) ] he is called one who strives for right action.This is called right action.
5) What then is right livelihood?
Not giving up the holy lineage, the qualities of purity and austerity;no hypocrisy, no boasting, no threats [to get gifts];being happy with whatever is given, content with little;good morality in conduct;no envy for the gain of others, contentment with one’s own gain, blamelessness, the livelihood permitted by the holy.This is called right livelihood.
6) What then is right effort?
The effort that is permitted by the mistaken but not the holy, the effort producing the habits of the vices which consists in cupidity, aversion and delusion is not intended;the effort that introduces rightly the holy way and truths, in accordance with the effort which produces the way to extinction;this is called right effort.
7) What then is right recollection?
Recollection that is well practised [always one-pointed],unshakable,straight,not crooked,seeing the faults and evils of existence,a guide on the way to extinction,recollection is the power of the intellect which consists in not forgetting the holy way.This is called right recollection.
8) What then is right concentration?
It is sameness in what is right [namely liberation], the sameness of all moments of existence;staying in that concentration and then entering the state of being determined to reach what is right for the sake of liberating all beings, this is called right concentration.Further, staying in that bodhisattva-concentration and then entering the state of being determined to reach what is right for the sake of liberating all beings, this is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable right concentration.
This is the way of the Awakened Lords of the past, future and present,and the bodhisattva, when completely awakened, shows it, points it out, makes it clear, accepted, known, announced, explains, displays, reveals, defines, proclaims and expounds it.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable way.
XV. Its Practice.(p. 146)
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ peaceful meditation and expanded vision are also imperishable.
71st Imperishable: Peaceful Meditation.
What then is the imperishability of peaceful meditation?
[Accumulations for peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāra): 1. The secondary accumulation (aprādhānyasaṃbhāra):][Inner] peace, [outer] calm and [inner and outer] tranquillity of thought [with no sloth and torpor (styānamiddha) ];[since it is peace, as there is not much inner thought-construction (vikalpa) ] no disturbance and [since it is calm as there are no thought-constructions of outer things] control of the senses;[since it is free of thought-constructions of both inner and outer things] neither haughtiness nor pride;no noisy speech [like that of kings and thieves];no unsteadiness [since it is not in the power of vices (klesavaśa) ];no wavering [as it cannot be disturbed by the adversaries of concentration (samādhivipakṣa) ];mildness [yielding to others],guarding oneself [since one vows not to enter the objects of the eyes and the other senses (cakṣurādîndriyaviṣaya) ],being well trained [or docility],fitness [being free of sloth and torpor (styānamiddha) ],one-pointedness,being content with being alone,avoiding crowds,happiness at being detached [feeling joy in one-pointed thought (cittaikāgrya) ],being detached in body [content with being alone and avoiding crowds],no fluctuation of thought,being mentally turned towards the wilderness [in the mountains and in caves (giriśailaguhā) ],having few wishes [for clothing (cīvara) and almsbowls (piṇḍapāta) ],not desiring [other things],not desiring much,contentment,purity of livelihood,perfection in behaviour,guarding one’s deportment,knowing the right time,knowing the proper moment,knowing the improper situation,knowledge of the proper quantity,moderation in eating,being easily fed,through careful consideration not being elated or depressed [when praised and reproached],enduring offensive and insulting ways of speech.
[The primary accumulation (prādhānyasaṃbhāra):]Producing thoughts bent on religious practice [that is producing thoughts for cultivating peaceful meditation and expanded vision (śamathavipaśyanābhāvanācittotpāda):]taking pleasure in retiring for meditation,mental effort with the limbs of meditation as the object,producing friendliness,and engendering compassion,[the two being roots of concentration (samādhi) ], establishing [one’s thoughts] in joy,[producing undisturbed concentration (akopyasamādhi), and thus] cultivating equanimity.
[Peaceful meditation itself is:]The first [state of] meditation, the second meditation, the third meditation, the fourth meditation, the field of [meditation where the] infinity of space [is experienced], the field of infinity of consciousness, the field of not anything in particular, the field of neither concept nor no concept, the cessation of concept and feeling, (p. 147) these nine successive states of meditation are called peaceful meditation.
Thus the accumulations for peaceful meditation are immeasurable [as the moments of existence which are causes of cultivating peaceful meditation (śamathabhāvanāhetu) are immeasurable like space (yathākāśa) ], and thus exertion in those accumulations of peaceful meditation is called imperishable peaceful meditation [since it produces immeasurable (apramāṇa) peaceful meditation].
72nd Imperishable: Expanded Vision.
What then is the imperishability of expanded vision?
It is the way of cultivation connected to insight [since expanded vision is the essence of insight (prajñāsvabhāva), it is all practice (abhyāsa) directed towards insight];knowledge of the immovability of moments of existence;[as there is no mover (kāraka), thus it is] knowledge of selflessness, no being, no life-principle, no life-supporting principle, no personality;knowledge seeing the parts of personality as an illusion;knowledge seeing the spheres of sense-perception as snake-poison;knowledge seeing the fields of sense-perception as an empty village;knowledge seeing the [four holy] truths as well understood;knowledge seeing things not in contradiction to dependent origination [that is, seeing all moments of existence as arising from causes and conditions (sarvadharmāṇāṃ hetupratyayôtpādadarśanam) ];knowledge seeing that which is beyond any viewpoint;knowledge seeing that the maturation of the fruit from its cause will never cease [as one performs action, one will accordingly experience its maturation];knowledge seeing through inspection the realization of the attainment of the fruit [of accumulating merit and knowledge (puṇyajñānasaṃbhāra), namely the extinction which is found nowhere (apratiṣṭhitanirvāṇa) ];knowledge seeing the attainment of truth [namely emptiness (śūnyatā) ] is expanded vision.
[Further] expanded vision is truly seeing the moments of existence,seeing the moments of existence as they are,seeing the essence of moments of existence,seeing that the moments of existence are as they are and not otherwise,seeing that the moments of existence are empty, without distinguishing marks and nothing to be longed for,seeing that the moments of existence are unconditioned, unborn, unoriginated, inexistent, just as they are, pure [in being originally brilliant (prakṛtiprabhāsvarāḥ) ] and separated [from and thus empty of the forms of subject and object (grāhyagrāhâkāraiḥ śūnyāḥ) ],seeing that the moments of existence are without [absolute] movement, without a mover, without an owner, not possible to own, undifferentiated, of one taste, having the essence of space, originally extinguished.
[Further] as for expanded vision,he does not see any form [existent own-being (svabhāva) or really existent state (bhāva) ] of existence,does not see any form [own-being (svabhāva) or really existent state (bhāva) ] of non-existence;does not see any form of originating, remaining and disappearing;does not see any form [or own-being (svabhāva) ] of objects [like form, sound, etc. (rūpaśabdâdi) ] nor of distinguishing marks [like white, red, etc. (śuklalohitādi) ].Though seeing he sees nothing,he sees when there is no seeing;(p. 148) by expanded vision he sees neither seeing nor non-seeing.When there is such seeing he sees truth, and by seeing the truth he attains skill in expanded vision [that is, skill with the essential characteristic (lakṣaṇa) of moments of existence].But the bodhisattva seeing by expanded vision does not fall into the unconditioned and does not leave off bringing the roots of good about.
This is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable expanded vision.
Those, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable peaceful meditation and expanded vision.
XVI. The Stage of Attaining Prediction
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ memory and eloquence are also imperishable.
73rd Imperishable: Memory.
What then is the imperishability of memory?
It is to keep [the letters (vyañjana) ], retain [the meaning (artha) ] in mind, never again to forget [the letters (vyañjana) ], and truly to retain [for the future the meaning (artha) of] the eighty-four thousand aggregates of religion by means of remembrance derived from the earlier piling up of roots of good.This is called memory.Further, memory is that by means of which one retains [the words and meaning (arthaśabda) of] the sayings of all Buddhas, retains the sayings of all bodhisattvas, isolated buddhas, disciples, of all beings, that by means of which one retains all good sayings without remainder.This is called memory.Even when he leaves for another world-age or another birth, the knowledge which consists in the recollection of memory of that bodhisattva is not lost or forgotten [so that there is pure remembrance, not so that one remembers some, but not all].With the eye of holy insight he sees all moments of existence as if they were an Āmalaka fruit in the palm of his hand.This is called imperishable memory.
74th Imperishable: Eloquence.(p. 149)
What then is the imperishability of eloquence?
The eloquence in question is unhindered eloquence,uninterrupted eloquence,insuperable eloquence,unconfused eloquence,ready eloquence,eloquence full of joy,quick eloquence,unchangeable eloquence,sharp eloquence,immediate eloquence. [This is the essential character (lakṣaṇa) of the bodhisattva’s eloquence].
That eloquence of his is purified through the maturation of earlier actions,blessed by the Buddhas,adopted by the gods,free of faulty grammar,teaching the unfailing religion,going the way to extinction;thus he becomes perfected in eloquence.
That bodhisattva’s manifestations of eloquence in teaching prose and verses are as many as there are manifestations of forms;that bodhisattva’s manifestations of eloquence in explaining prose and verses are as many as there are words sounded.He does not entertain thought-constructions like: “I demonstrate this, I teach this”.But even though he is not conditioned by anything, to whatever assembly he goes, be it an assembly of aristocrats, be it an assembly of priests, be it an assembly of craftsmen, be it an assembly of house-owners, be it an assembly of ascetics, be it an assembly of the four protectors of the world, be it an assembly of the thirty-three gods, be it an assembly of the death-king, be it an assembly of the gods in the delightful heaven, be it an assembly of the gods who take delight in changing, be it an assembly of the gods powerful in changing into someone else, be it an assembly of the Evil One, be it an assembly of Brahmā, in all those assemblies his religious teachings appear clearly in accordance with the faith and abilities of all beings, by virtue of his effortlessness [of eloquence].If he so wishes, he does not leave off even if another life elapses, or another world-age elapses, he teaches religion unhindered.And this teaching of religion of his succeeds, for the one who practises it, in truly bringing about the cessation of suffering [of beings].
This is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable eloquence.
These, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are the bodhisattvas’ imperishable memory and eloquence.
XVII. Defining the Attainment of That.(p. 150)
75th – 78th Imperishable: Summaries of Religion.
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ four summaries of religion are also imperishable.
What four?
1) Entering the knowledge of the bodhisattvas’ imperishable teaching that all conditioned things are impermanent;2) entering the knowledge of the bodhisattvas’ imperishable teaching that all conditioned things are suffering;3) entering the knowledge of the bodhisattvas’ imperishable teaching that all moments of existence are selfless;and 4) entering the knowledge of the bodhisattvas’ imperishable teaching that extinction is peace.
1) What then does ’impermanent’ refer to?
It [impermanent as here intended] refers to non-existence [that all moments of existence are empty (śūnya),according to highest truth (paramārthatas) there is no state of permanence (nityabhāva) in any moment of existence (dharma) imagined as subject and object (grāhyagrāhakaparikalpita)]and non-attachment [as there is no existent substance (bhava) as “me” and “mine”, etc. (ātmâtmīya) to be attached to],not the disappearance of something existent [not that something exists and then does not exist when it has disappeared, but rather that things are essentially not permanent, that is, originally non-existent];impermanent refers to the absence of self in all moments of existence and there [in that emptiness (śūnyatā), being permanently empty (nityaśūnya) ] there is no disappearance as it is [always (nityam) ] apart from any essential existence [of subject and object (grāhyagrāhaka) ].
This is what ’impermanent’ refers to.
2) What then does ’suffering’ refer to?
Suffering refers to absence of joy;joy perishing is what suffering refers to,that there is nothing to long for is what suffering refers to,explaining the word suffering is what suffering refers to [it perishes being only a word, saying the word suffering perishes in suffering since no entity (vastu or bhāva) of suffering is found],explaining what empty space is is what suffering refers to [as suffering is nothing but emptiness, and the referendum in question when explaining what is empty like space is the referendum of suffering].
This is what ’suffering’ refers to.
3) What then does ’selflessness’ refer to?
The self [which is of two kinds, the one constructed (kalpita) by others, and the one appearing in connection with subject and object (grāhyagrāhaka), is without the true existence of a self (ātmabhāva) and thus] is absolutely selfless,what selflessness refers to is vain, meaningless, void and empty,and what emptiness refers to is what selflessness refers to.
This is what ’selflessness’ refers to.
4) What then does ’peaceful’ refer to
The peaceful does not get peaceful by peace, the peaceful itself is peaceful [peaceful means empty (śūnya) or extinguished (nirvṛta), but it does not become peaceful or empty through knowledge of understanding an essence of peace (śāntasvabhāva) in emptiness or extinction, things are rather originally and from the beginning peaceful and empty (prakṛtyādiśāntaśūnya) ],and also the non-peaceful does not get peaceful by peace [the conditioned (saṃskṛta) things in existence do not become peaceful and non-existent after one has understood them as peaceful and empty through knowledge, they are from the beginning originally unborn and peaceful (ādiprakṛtyanutpannaśānta) ].What [the word (śabda) ] peaceful refers to is the allaying of distinguishing marks [like action (karma), vices (kleśa), subject and object (grāhyagrāhaka) ],this is peace;and [to teach the state of peacefulness (śāntabhāva):] the peaceful is extinction.
This is what ’peaceful’ refers to.
These, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are the bodhisattvas’ four imperishable summaries of religion.
XVIII. Isolated Awakening.(p. 151)
79th Imperishable: The Way Traversed Alone.
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ way traversed alone is also imperishable.
What then is the way traversed alone?
On the way traversed alone the bodhisattvas are not dependent on any other.The way traversed alone [which is the one way (ekayāna), is as follows]:alone, without a second, without a companion, the bodhisattva puts on armour [producing the thought of incomparable awakening he acts with vigour (vīrya) ] for the sake of incomparable complete awakening.With determination in which his own vigour, strength and power are included, beyond situations created by others, autonomous, he distinguishes himself in power by his own power, thus he is armoured in strong armour:“Whatever living beings will attain, that I will attain;what all the holy ones and all the bodhisattvas who have recently entered the way will attain, that I will attain.
Generosity is not my companion, I am rather the companion of generosity;morality, tolerance, vigour, meditation and insight are not my companions, I am rather the companion of morality, tolerance, vigour, meditation and insight;
I am not to be served by the perfections, the perfections are rather to be served by me.I am not to be served by the means of attraction, the means of attraction are rather to be served by me;I am not to be served by all the good moments of existence, all the good moments of existence are rather to be served by me.
By the said moments of existence I will wake up to the incomparable complete awakening by insight [which is knowledge free of thought-construction (nirvikalpajñāna) ] connected to the moment of thought [when reaching awakening], without a companion, autonomous, beyond situations created by others, alone, without a second, established without a companion on the adamantine place on earth, having subdued the Evil One with his forces and army.Thus he wakes up.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable way traversed alone.
XIX. Turning the Wheel of Religion.(p. 152)
80th Imperishable: Expedient Means.
Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ expedient means are also imperishable.
What then is expedient means?
[In short,] that by which the bodhisattva creates and activates all the teachings of a Buddha [the perfections (pāramitā), wings of awakening (bodhipakṣika), etc.] is expedient means.
[The following describes how it is:] The bodhisattva’s practice of all good moments of existence [giving birth as god or human being] is expedient means;introspection into one’s intention is expedient means;unbroken practice is expedient means;desiring with determination religious teachings which are distinguished [from those of disciples and isolated buddhas, namely those of the great way] is expedient means;fulfilling all the perfections through generosity is expedient means;assuming any kind of birth with morality is expedient means;to adorn body, speech and mind with tolerance for the sake of awakening is expedient means;exertion for beginning and carrying through with vigour is expedient means;knowledge of returning from [the worlds of] meditation (dhyānadhātu) to be born in the world of passion (kāmadhātu) through meditation is expedient means;giving up the unconditioned [while understanding it; not remaining in the sphere of the unconditioned (asaṃskṛtadhātu),but doing things pertaining to the conditioned (saṃskṛtakṛtya) ] with insight is expedient means;protecting the unprotected with friendliness is expedient means;not being contemptuous of existence because of one’s compassion is expedient means;to endure pleasant and unpleasant with joy is expedient means;to heap up all the accumulations of roots of the good with equanimity is expedient means;attaining the sight of a Buddha by means of divine sight is expedient means;attaining the hearing of a Buddha by means of divine hearing is expedient means;attaining knowledge of superior and inferior abilities through knowledge of others’ thoughts is expedient means;unattached knowledge of the three times through remembering earlier places of birth is expedient means;attaining the magical power of a Buddha with knowledge of the methods of magical power is expedient means;entering the intentions of living beings is expedient means;knowledge of the characteristics of behaviour is expedient means;descending after having ascended, ascending after having descended [that is, though having attained the above-mentioned qualities by meditation (dhyāna), etc., by the power of expedient means (upāyavaśena) he returns and keeps practising on lower stages (bhūmi) ] is expedient means;vice by virtue of freedom from vice [that is, having got rid of the hindrances of vices and knowledge of objects (kleśajñeyâvaraṇa), being without vices (niṣkleśabhūta), but appearing full of vices (kliṣṭa) in existence (saṃsāra) for the sake of living beings (sattvārtha) ] is expedient means;when, having put down the burden [of the five parts of personality (pañcaskandha) ], he [though unsullied (anāsravabhūta) ] takes up the burden [again for the sake of living beings (sattvārtha) ] it is expedient means;displaying the measurable as immeasurable is expedient means;displaying the immeasurable as measurable is expedient means;making things clear to those with weak abilities is expedient means;knowledge of the right and wrong time [to act] is expedient means;going by bad ways [the ways of existence (saṃsāramārga) ] though being on the way [viz. the sacred way (āryamārga) ] so as to set beings who are on bad ways on the right way is expedient means;making much out of little [by transforming into incomparable awakening (anuttarabodhipariṇāmanā) with pure intention (śuddhâśayena) small things, gifts, etc.], making the immeasurable out of much [with the purity of transforming (pariṇāmanāpariśuddhyā) great things, gifts, etc.] is expedient means;reconciling beings in discord is expedient means;when he stays with the weak, the average and the able, it is expedient means;when he falls from the practice of extinction to the practice of existence, it is expedient means;when he seeks bondage while liberated, it is expedient means;when, though he makes objects [both conditioned (saṃskṛta) and unconditioned (asaṃskṛta) ] of cognition perish [understanding them as empty (śūnya) ], he does not fall into [the extreme of emptiness (śūnyânta), namely] the destruction of objects of cognition, it is expedient means;when, though he [when practising intent on the good of living beings (sattvārthacaritakāle) ] relaxes the proper modes of deportment [of practising meditation, concentration, etc. (dhyānasamādhyādicarita) ], he does not give up the proper modes of deportment [which is the aim of meditation and concentration (dhyānasamādhyartha) ], it is expedient means;having living beings in view, (p. 153) not the morality [of the vows of the monastic code (prātimokṣasaṃvara) ] is expedient means;adopting viewpoints to attract [beings to educate them], not to make disaccord [like the tīrthikas] is expedient means;speaking [and thus teaching religion with words and expressions through expedient means for the sake of living beings, though understanding that all moments of existence are beyond expression (anabhilāpya) ] is expedient means;expedient means has the threefold world as its range;the practice having the character of attaining the three gates to liberation is expedient means;mixing with the unholy [even though being holy oneself (ātmaîvâryabhūto ’pi) ] and not mixing with the holy is expedient means;having turned the view away from extinction [though having attained it] and facing existence [for the sake of beings (sattvārtha) ] is expedient means;the light of no vices even in the region of the Evil One [the sphere of passion (kāmadhātu) ] is expedient means;[knowledge that, according to concealed truth (saṃvṛtitas),] all [substances (bhāva) may be born] from any [substance, and, according to the highest truth (paramārthatas), understanding that] none [not even a single substance, is born] from any [substance] is expedient means.
This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable expedient means.
These, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are the bodhisattvas’ eighty imperishables; in these imperishables all the Buddhas’ teachings are included and summarized.
XX. Presenting
1) [Greatness of the teaching (nirdeśamahātmya):] When this chapter on the entrance into the imperishable moments of existence was taught by the bodhisattva Akṣayamati, seventy-eight thousand beings produced the thought of incomparable complete awakening, and fifty-two thousand bodhisattvas attained tolerance to the fact that all moments of existence are unborn.
2) [Offering to and praising the Teacher (śāstṛpūjāstuti):] To honour that exposition of religion the whole of that assembly sprinkled flower-garlands, flower-parasols (p. 154) and flower-ear-ornaments of different colours and fragrances on the Lord and the bodhisattva Akṣayamati.
And gods up in the air exclaimed singing:
– The incomparable complete awakening attained by the Awakened Lords in a hundred thousand times ten million times a hundred thousand million immeasurable world-ages has been taught by the bodhisattva Akṣayamati in this exposition of religion in an imperishable form.And the beings who hear this exposition of religion, the chapter which is an entrance into imperishability, and having heard it believe in it, write it out, understand it, retain it, read it, master it and explain it fully to others, they will be endowed with this imperishability.
3) [Joy of the Teacher (śāstranumodana):] Then the Lord took from his own body a piece of cloth, and giving it to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati as a gift of religion, he said:
– Good, good, son of good family, this exposition of religion was well spoken by you, and the Tathāgata rejoices because of you.And because of my joy for you, as many Awakened Lords as there are sands in the river Gaṅgā also rejoice.
Then the bodhisattva Akṣayamati received this piece of cloth with both hands, and putting it on his head he said:
– May this which we have obtained from the body of the Lord turn into a relic-shrine for the whole world with its gods, human beings and giants!
4) [Gratefulness towards and joy because of the spiritual friend and the teaching (kalyāṇamitranirdeśakṛtajñatânumodana):] Then pieces of cloth with jewels, jewel-canopies, jewel-flags, jewel-pennants formed into jewel-garlands, and wreaths of cloth adorned with jewels were seen coming from the ten directions.Having come they covered the body of the bodhisattva Akṣayamati, and from those cloths with jewels, jewel-canopies, jewel-flags and wreaths of jewel-pennants came the sound:
– Good, good, Akṣayamati, well spoken by you, Akṣayamati, was this chapter on the entrance into imperishability, we rejoice because of these well spoken words of yours.
Then the reverend Śāradvatīputra addressed himself to the Lord, saying:
– From where, Lord, do these cloths with jewels, jewel-canopies, jewel-flags and wreaths of jewel-pennants come from, from where does the sound come?
The Lord said:
– When this bodhisattva Akṣayamati, reverend Śāradvatīputra, formerly trained himself in the practice of the bodhisattva, beings were matured by him for the sake of incomparable complete awakening, and now they are completely awakened to the incomparable complete awakening in the worlds of the ten directions.(p. 155) Feeling thankfulness and gratefulness to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati they proclaim the true qualities of that son of good family, and they offer these gifts of religion to honour his exposition of religion which is a chapter of the Great Collection.
5) [Esteeming the Teacher and the teaching (śāstṛnirdeśacitrīkāra):] Then the whole of that assembly felt very great joy, pleasure and delight in the bodhisattva Akṣayamati and spoke thus:
We have got something very good, that we have got to see the bodhisattva Akṣayamati, to praise him, honour him, serve him and listen to this exposition of religion.Those beings who hear the name of the bodhisattva Akṣayamati have got something very good, to say nothing of those who see him directly with their physical eyes, hear this exposition of religion, and having heard it believe in it, write it out, understand it, retain it, read it, master it and explain it fully to others!
6) [Giving the cause of that (taddhetu):] Then the Lord, rejoicing in these well-spoken words of that assembly, told the reverend Śāradvatīputra:
– Even if sons of good family, Śāradvatīputra, or daughters of good family on the way of the bodhisattvas, remaining here with a life-span of a world-age, should give presents to the Awakened Lords, train themselves in morality and all rules of conduct, endure the wrongdoings of all living beings, undertake vigour so that it seems that his head and clothing are on fire, practise one-pointed meditation, and be able in distinguishing by insight, I would say that their perfections are not fulfilled if they are lacking this exposition of religion.But the sons of good family, Śāradvatīputra, or the daughters of good family on the way of the bodhisattvas who hear this exposition of religion, and having heard it believe in it, write it out, understand it, retain it, read it, master it and explain it fully to others, and who are intent on the practice of cultivating [themselves continually in the meaning of imperishability (akṣayârtha)], I say that they fulfil their perfections and will soon wake up to the incomparable complete awakening.
Why?For the bodhisattva, Śāradvatīputra, who reveals this exposition of religion, and explains it fully to others, this is his fulfilment of the perfection of generosity. Why? Because the gift of religion is the best of gifts.
The morality, rules of conduct and vows practised in this exposition of religion without forgetting the thought of awakening [wishing the good of others] are his fulfilment of the perfection of morality. Why? Because the training of all the bodhisattvas is explained in this exposition of religion.
The bodhisattva’s tolerance taught in this exposition of religion cannot be disturbed by any being; this tolerance which conforms to all moments of existence [being in accordance with the imperishable moments of existence] is the highest of the perfections of tolerance.
(p. 156) Vigour of body, speech and thought in reciting, teaching, practising [or pondering on] and cultivating this exposition of religion is the perfection of vigour.
Introspection into thoughts concerned with this exposition of religion, such undisturbed, one-pointed introspection is the highest of the perfections of meditation.
Actual knowledge, knowledge dependent on no-one else, knowledge discerning [the essential characteristics (lakṣaṇa) of the imperishables in a pure way], knowledge of progress when this exposition of religion is taught is the highest of the perfections of insight.
Thus, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattva who is intent on this exposition of religion will fulfil the cultivation of these six perfections with little difficulty.They [the perfections], reverend Śāradvatīputra, are to be known thus through this exposition of religion.As for the bodhisattva who knows this exposition by heart or has it written down in a book, for him all the qualities of a Buddha [the powers, intrepidities, etc. (balavaiśāradyâdi)] should be known as being in the palm of his hand.Even if the great elements changed, the awakening of that bodhisattva would not change.Why?This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the seal of the bodhisattvas never turning back [it is the point of support which leads them through the ten stages];and those bodhisattvas will unite with that seal [through having attained this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) they will attain all expositions of religion].Those who have their attention turned towards this seal, they have their attention turned towards all the qualities of a Buddha.
7) [Promises to protect the teaching (nirdeśarakṣāpratijñā):] Then the Four Great Kings with their forces and retinues joined their hands in respect to the Lord, and having honoured him they said:
– Lord, we, the Four Great Kings are disciples of the Lord who have entered the stream.Lord, we are prepared to assist and serve those sons of good family and daughters of good family who keep this exposition of religion;Lord, we will produce the concept that these preachers of religion are like the Teacher.And why? Because all ways originate from this.
Then Śakra, king of the gods, said to the Lord:
– Even though we, Lord, have heard many hundreds of thousands of expositions of religion from the Lord, we have never heard such a teaching with the well-decided meaning of the moments of existence.As for this exposition of religion, Lord, wherever it is recited and explained, in a village, town, city, district or capital, there I will go with the thirty-three gods to listen to religion, and I will effect the protection of the religion of these religious preachers.There will be no fear of anything among those sons of good family, and when they, without fear for the congregations, enter upon this exposition of religion and teach it extensively to others, I will give them vigour, power, strength, endurance, eloquence, recollection, reason and understanding.
(p. 157) The Lord said:
– Very good, very good, Kauśika, that you are one to effect the protection of those preachers of religion. If the preachers of religion, Kauśika, are helped, true religion is helped, and if true religion is helped all beings are helped.
Then Brahmā the Lord of Sahā addressed himself to the Lord saying:
– Lord, leaving the pleasure and comfort of meditation, I will, with the gods of the company of Brahmā, go to hear that exposition of religion, wherever this exposition of religion circulates.There the preachers of religion will know by four signs that: “Brahmā, Lord of Sahā, has come here with the gods of the company of Brahmā to hear religion”.What four?1) The vision of great splendour,2) the smelling of divine fragrances,3) the eloquence of those preachers of religion with recollection not forgetting the explanations explained or the meanings of the words to be connected to the words,and 4) the fact that all those assemblies listen to religion with undistracted thoughts and respectful attention to the dharma.By those four signs one will know that Brahmā, Lord of Sahā, has come here with the gods of the company of Brahmā.
Then the Evil One addressed himself to the Lord:
– By this exposition of religion, Lord, all my forces with their equipment are weakened.Why? The bodhisattva, Lord, who hears this exposition of religion, by that very act that bodhisattva is prophesied to attain incomparable perfect awakening.And Lord, established in a buddha-field somewhere, he is to be called a Buddha himself.My conceitedness, pride and arrogance, Lord, are struck down by the mass of majesty and power of the bodhisattva Akṣayamati and this exposition of religion.I promise to protect, shield and guard those preachers of religion, and where this exposition of religion circulates I will not go to make hindrances even for one moment of thought.
8) [Entrusting the teaching (nirdeśārpaṇā):] Then the Lord addressed himself to the venerable Ānanda:
– Grasp this exposition of religion, Ānanda, read it and master it so that true religion may endure.
Ānanda said:
– Lord, I have grasped this exposition of religion. It is, however, impossible for me to disseminate it like the great beings, the bodhisattvas.
The Lord said:– As things are, Ānanda, be at rest when it concerns the wide distribution of this exposition of religion.(p. 158) The bodhisattvas who are to disseminate this exposition of religion in the ten directions, as helpers of true religion, have come together and are present here.
Then a hundred million bodhisattvas addressed themselves to the Lord for the sake of helping religion:
– Lord, in the worlds of the ten directions we will fulfil completely and disseminate this exposition of religion, a chapter of the Great Collection.And in this world Sahā, the bodhisattva, the great being Maitreya will disseminate this exposition of religion to help true religion, to protect true religion.In the final time, the final five hundred years [of the thousand years which religion lasts] following the complete extinction of the Lord, the bodhisattvas to whose hearing this exposition of religion comes, and by whom it is grasped, retained, recited and explained, are to be known as blessed by the presence of the bodhisattva Maitreya.
Then the Lord addressed himself to those bodhisattvas, those helpers of true religion:
– Very good, very good, sons of good family; as you are now ready to help true religion in my presence, in the same way you are ready to help true religion in the presence of so many Awakened Lords as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā.
9) [Forbearance with an inconsistent teaching (viruddhadeśanākṣamaṇa):] Then the bodhisattva, the great being Akṣayamati addressed himself to the Lord:
– Because of my weak intelligence, Lord, the meaning, sentences and letters in this exposition of religion are not fulfilled by me, so I ask the Lord and these bodhisattvas and great beings furnished with imperishable moments of existence to forgive that.
The Lord said:
– For the bodhisattvas who have attained the unhindered knowledges, Akṣayamati, there are no blunders when it concerns meaning, moments of existence, explanation or eloquence, nor are there any blunders in cessation [that is, in teaching emptiness (śūnyatā)].And the good men who have understood these moments of existence have attained the decided true meaning [which enables them to teach].And you, Akṣayamati, have attained distinction [from the disciples] and excellence [among the bodhisattvas] as well as mastery of the four knowledges, and in this Great Way you are not dependent on any other, having attained distinction and excellence in discerning.For the bodhisattvas, Akṣayamati, who have reached this state, there are no blunders at all in body, speech or thought, and all of them are furnished with actions of body, speech and thought which are preceded by knowledge.Many hundred thousand times million times hundred thousand millions of Buddhas will remember you because of the teaching of religion.Those like me, Akṣayamati, are infinitely accepting of good men like you.
10) [Asking for the title (nāmapraśna):] Then the venerable Ānanda addressed himself to the Lord:What, Lord, is the name of this exposition of religion, how shall I retain it?
11) [Giving the title (nāmakaraṇa):] The Lord said:
– Retain this exposition of religion, Ānanda, as Akṣayamati’s Teaching, retain it as The Teaching on Imperishable Meanings, Words and Syllables, as A Chapter of the Great Collection, as Akṣayamati’s Chapter.If you, Ānanda, grasp this exposition of religion, a chapter of the Great Collection, you will attain hundred thousand-fold the possession of power and strength in the recollection of moments of existence, and if you teach it to others you will attend living beings everywhere with Buddha-action.
Thus spoke the Lord, and, carried away with joy, all those crowds of bodhisattvas, the bodhisattva great being Akṣayamati, the venerable Śāradvatīputra, those monks, the whole of that assembly, and the world with its gods, human beings, giants and celestial musicians praised what the Lord had said.
The Mahāyāna Sūtra Akṣayamatinirdeśa from the The Hundred Thousand Great Collection is ended.
